# AlgoPirates Program Guide
## A Complete Implementation Guide for Teachers and Parents

---

## 📚 Program Overview

AlgoPirates is an 8-week, 40-session summer math program designed for rising 5th graders that combines paper-based mathematics with optional Python coding activities. The program is carefully structured to prevent summer learning loss while building computational thinking skills.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Math First, Code Second**: Paper worksheets form the foundation of learning, with Python activities serving as optional enrichment that mirrors and extends mathematical concepts.

**Evidence-Based Design**: Built on four research-backed pillars:
- **Distributed micro-practice** (15/30/45-min sessions) prevents summer learning loss
- **Worked-example first** design reduces cognitive load
- **Unplugged → Python bridge** builds computational thinking
- **Explicit, direct instruction** maximizes learning gains

### 🏆 Learning Goals

| Priority | Outcome | Success Measure |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Primary** | Solid proficiency in place value, fractions→decimals→percents, geometry of area, intro variables | 80% mastery on 20-item pre/post quiz |
| **Secondary** | Comfort writing ~15-line Python notebooks; debug common syntax errors | Portfolio of 10 executed notebooks with student annotations |

## 📅 8-Week Curriculum Schedule

### Week Structure
- **5 sessions per week** (Monday-Friday)
- **15-45 minutes per session**
- **Optional coding** 1-2 times per week
- **Paper-first approach** always

| Week | Topic | Math Focus | Python Activity | Session Length |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **1** | 🔢 Number Sense | Place value, multiplication/division algorithms | `tower_blocks.ipynb` (12 lines) | 30-45 min |
| **2** | 🍕 Fractions | Strip diagrams, equivalence, operations | `fraction_wall.ipynb` (14 lines) | 30-45 min |
| **3** | 🔄 Patterns | Number sequences, Conway's Life rules | `life_sim.ipynb` (18 lines) | 15-30 min |
| **4** | 📐 Geometry | Rectangle/triangle area, perimeter | `pixel_flag.ipynb` (15 lines) | 30-45 min |
| **5** | 📊 Data & Chance | Bar graphs, mean, probability | `coin_flips.ipynb` (17 lines) | 30-45 min |
| **6** | 💰 Decimals & Money | Rounding, change-making algorithms | `make_change.ipynb` (16 lines) | 30-45 min |
| **7** | 🔤 Variables | Patterns, 1-step equations | `cube_maker.ipynb` (13 lines) | 15-30 min |
| **8** | 🧩 Strategy | Problem-solving, logic games, Nim | `nim_bot.ipynb` (19 lines) | 15-30 min |

### Daily Session Structure

Each worksheet follows this proven format:

1. **⏱ Duration Icon** - Clear time expectation (15/30/45 minutes)
2. **🔍 Worked Example** - Step-by-step model (max 5 steps)
3. **📝 Guided Practice** - 3 problems with decreasing support:
   - Q1: Scaffolded (fill-in-the-blank)
   - Q2: Partially scaffolded 
   - Q3: Independent practice
4. **🚀 Stretch/Colab Box** - Optional coding or extension
5. **🎯 Exit Ticket** - Reflection prompt + parent check box

## 🎓 Pedagogical Approach

### Mathematical Habits of Mind

Each worksheet highlights one key thinking habit:
- **Look for patterns** (Week 3)
- **Make connections** (Week 2, 7)
- **Reason abstractly** (Week 1, 6)
- **Model with mathematics** (Week 4, 5)
- **Use appropriate tools** (Week 8)

### Scaffolding Strategy

**Gradual Release of Responsibility**:
1. **I Do**: Worked example shows complete solution
2. **We Do**: Guided practice with decreasing support
3. **You Do**: Independent application and transfer

### Cognitive Load Management

- **One concept per session** to avoid overload
- **Worked examples first** before practice
- **Plain language** (CEFR B1 level, <20 words/sentence)
- **Visual hierarchy** with consistent formatting

## 💻 Python Integration Guidelines

### When to Use Coding

**Optional Enhancement**: Python activities are enriching but never required. Students can complete the full program with paper only.

**Typical Schedule**:
- **2-3 coding sessions per week** maximum
- **Usually Wednesday/Friday** when energy is high
- **After paper mastery** - code mirrors math concepts

### Technical Requirements

**Minimal Setup**:
- Internet browser
- Free Google account (for Google Colab)
- No software installation required

**Coding Standards**:
- Single code cell per notebook
- ≤20 executable lines maximum
- Only built-in Python + `random` + `matplotlib.pyplot` (Week 5 only)
- Clear `### TODO ###` markers for student work

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**#1 Bug: IndentationError**
- Solution: Show consistent use of 4 spaces
- Paper fallback: "Describe in words what the code should do"

**Colab Access Problems**:
- Use school/library computers if home access unavailable
- Provide paper alternatives for all coding activities

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Parent/Teacher Support

### Daily Implementation

**For Parents**:
1. **Print worksheets** one week at a time
2. **Set consistent time** (same time daily builds habit)
3. **Review exit tickets** and check parent box
4. **Celebrate progress** using visual tracker

**For Teachers**:
1. **Use in summer school** or enrichment programs
2. **Adapt timing** to classroom schedule
3. **Leverage answer keys** with built-in teaching tips
4. **Monitor progress** through exit ticket patterns

### Assessment Strategy

| Tool | Timing | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **20-item Math Quiz** | Week 0 & Week 9 | Measure +20% score gain |
| **"Debug-me" Python Task** | Week 4 & Week 8 | Find 3 bugs, fix ≥2 |
| **Portfolio Reflection** | End of summer | 100-word math↔code connection |

### Weekly Check-ins

**Conversation Starters**:
- "What math pattern did you discover this week?"
- "How did the computer code help you understand the math?"
- "Which problem was trickiest? How did you solve it?"

**Red Flags** (intervention needed):
- Consistent exit ticket frustration
- Multiple incomplete sessions
- Avoiding coding activities entirely

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Math Difficulties

**Place Value Confusion** (Week 1):
- Use physical base-10 blocks or drawings
- Practice with money (dollars = thousands, dimes = tens)

**Fraction Frustration** (Week 2):
- Cut up pizza/pie for hands-on experience  
- Use fraction wall visual extensively

**Abstract Thinking** (Week 7):
- Start with concrete numbers before variables
- Use balance scale metaphor for equations

### Technical Issues

**Colab Won't Load**:
1. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Use incognito/private mode
4. Switch to mobile device if available

**Code Won't Run**:
1. Check indentation (4 spaces, not tabs)
2. Look for missing colons after if/for/while
3. Verify parentheses and quotes match
4. Use paper fallback if problems persist
