# Google Colab Quick Start Guide
**For Parents and Teachers - AlgoPirates Programming Activities**

## What is Google Colab?

Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a **free online platform** that lets students run Python code directly in their web browser. No installation required - just a Google account and internet connection!

**Perfect for beginners because:**
- ✅ Nothing to download or install
- ✅ Works on any device with a browser
- ✅ Automatically saves work to Google Drive
- ✅ Pre-installed with everything students need

---

## Before You Start

### What You Need:
- Computer, tablet, or Chromebook
- Stable internet connection
- Free Google account (Gmail)
- 15-20 minutes per coding session

### What Students Will Do:
- Complete **1 coding activity per week** (optional)
- Fill in missing code in pre-written programs
- Run programs to see immediate results
- Experiment and modify code safely

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create a Google Account (if needed)
- Go to [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
- Choose "Create account" → "For personal use"
- Follow the setup process
- **Parent Note:** You can create an account for young children

### 2. Access Google Colab
- Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Sign in with the Google account
- You'll see the Colab welcome page

### 3. Open a Notebook
- Click "GitHub" tab in the file browser
- Enter: `nibzard/AlgoPirates`
- Navigate to the week you want: `colab_tasks/` folder
- Click on any `.ipynb` file to open it

## How to Use a Notebook

### Understanding the Interface
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AlgoPirates - Week 1 Notebook       │ ← Title
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ # Run me! See today's paper sheet   │ ← Instructions
│ print("Hello, AlgoPirates!")        │ ← Code cell
│                                     │
│ ▶️ [Run]                            │ ← Run button
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Running Code
1. **Click on a code cell** (gray box with code)
2. **Press the ▶️ play button** or press `Shift + Enter`
3. **Wait for output** to appear below the cell
4. **Continue to next cell** when ready

### Completing TODO Sections
Look for comments like:
```python
### TODO ### Fill in the missing code
answer = ___  # STUDENT: Replace ___ with the correct formula
```

Students should:
1. Read the hint comments
2. Replace `___` with appropriate code
3. Run the cell to test their answer
4. Experiment with different values

## Common Troubleshooting

### "This notebook requires a runtime"
- **Solution:** Click "Connect" in the top-right corner
- **Wait:** 10-30 seconds for connection
- **Try again:** Run the code cell

### "Error: NameError"
- **Cause:** Student skipped a cell or didn't run cells in order
- **Solution:** Start from the top and run each cell in sequence

### "Nothing happens when I click Run"
- **Check:** Make sure you're signed into Google
- **Try:** Refresh the page and open notebook again
- **Wait:** Some cells take a few seconds to execute

### "I changed something and broke it"
- **Solution:** Go to Runtime → Restart Runtime
- **Then:** Run all cells from the beginning
- **Alternative:** Close notebook and reopen from GitHub

## Safety and Privacy

### What Google Colab Can Access:
- ✅ Code you write in notebooks
- ✅ Files you upload to the session
- ❌ Cannot access your computer files
- ❌ Cannot access other Google accounts
- ❌ Cannot install anything on your device

### Best Practices:
- **Supervise young children** during first few sessions
- **Don't share personal information** in code comments
- **Log out** when finished on shared computers
- **Save work** by downloading notebooks if desired

## Tips for Success

### For Parents:
- **Sit with your child** during the first session
- **Encourage experimentation** - breaking code is learning!
- **Focus on effort** over getting the "right" answer
- **Connect to math concepts** from the paper worksheets
- **Celebrate small wins** - first successful run is exciting!

### For Teachers:
- **Demo the first notebook** to the whole class
- **Pair students** for peer support
- **Have backup activities** for technical difficulties
- **Emphasize** that coding is optional but enriching
- **Share student creations** when they modify code creatively

### For Students:
- **Read all the comments** before changing code
- **Try different numbers** to see what happens
- **Don't worry about breaking things** - you can always restart
- **Ask for help** if something doesn't make sense
- **Have fun!** These are games and explorations, not tests

## Alternative Access Methods

### If Google Colab Doesn't Work:
1. **Download notebook files** from GitHub
2. **Upload to any Jupyter environment** (like JupyterLab)
3. **Use Trinket.io** for simpler Python activities
4. **Focus on paper activities** - coding is supplementary!

### Offline Options:
- **Download Python** (python.org) for advanced users
- **Use Scratch** for younger students
- **Try CodeCombat** for game-based learning
- **Explore micro:bit** for physical computing
