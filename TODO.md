# Task List Style Guide

- **Format**: `- [ ] [P1] Task` for incomplete or `- [x] [P1] Task (YYYY-MM-DD)` when complete.
- **Priorities**:
  - `P1` – High priority, foundational or blocking items.
  - `P2` – Medium priority, improves quality or completeness.
  - `P3` – Low priority, nice-to-have enhancements.
- **Subtasks**: Indent with two spaces under the parent task.
- **Grouping**: Organize tasks under thematic headings (Setup, Content, etc.).
- **Updates**: When work finishes, change `[ ]` to `[x]` and optionally add a completion date.
