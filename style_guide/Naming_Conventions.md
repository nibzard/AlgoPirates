# Naming Conventions

Follow these rules when adding files or notebooks:

- Worksheets use the pattern `W<week>_Day<day>_Sheet.md`.
- Answer keys use `W<week>_Day<day>_Answers.md`.
- Notebooks live in `weeks/week<week>_*/` and mirror the worksheet name, e.g. `W3_Day3_Colab.ipynb`.
- Colab tasks in the `colab_tasks/` folder are short names like `tower_blocks.ipynb` as listed in `specs.md`.
