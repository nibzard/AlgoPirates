# Writer Handbook

This handbook condenses the authoring rules from `specs.md`.

## File & Layout Rules
1. Each worksheet fits on one A4 page. Use the back only for long (45‑min) tasks.
2. Sections appear in this order: Duration icon, Worked Example, Guided Practice, Stretch/Colab box, Exit Ticket.
3. Worked example boxes use 12 pt Montserrat; code samples use Consolas 11 pt.

## Language & Tone
- Use plain Global English.
- Frame tasks as mini‑quests ("Your mission: ...") to motivate learners.
- Highlight one Mathematical Habit of Mind per sheet.

## Coding Conventions
- Notebooks contain a single code cell with ≤20 executable lines.
- Begin with the comment `# Run me!  See today's paper sheet for the plan.`
- Place `### TODO ###` markers where students type code.
- Only the `random` module and (in Week 5) `matplotlib.pyplot` are allowed.

## Styling & Branding
Follow the program's style guide and cite external problems in the footer to honor licenses.
