# Python Style Guide

This project follows a lightweight style inspired by PEP 8 and the specs.

- Keep notebooks short: one code cell with at most 20 executable lines.
- The first cell should contain the comment:
  ```python
  # Run me!  See today's paper sheet for the plan.
  ```
- Insert `### TODO ###` comments where learners must complete code.
- Use only Python built-ins and `random`. Week 5 notebooks may also use `matplotlib.pyplot`.
- Aim for descriptive variable names using `snake_case`.
