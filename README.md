## 🌟 Overview

This open-source project provides a full **8-week, 40-session** summer preparation course for students entering 5th grade. Each session is centered around:

- **Math-first, paper-based tasks** aligned with international grade-level standards
- **Optional Python coding tasks**, using Google Colab, that mirror or extend the math concepts
- **Minimal parent supervision required** – just print and go!
- **No Minecraft or specialized software needed** – runs in any browser via Colab

Designed to bridge traditional math fluency with modern computational thinking, the program builds confidence and enjoyment in both subjects.

### ✨ What Makes This Special

- **📄 Print-and-Go Worksheets** - Each day's activity fits on one A4 page with clear instructions
- **🎯 Worked Examples First** - Every worksheet starts with a detailed example to reduce cognitive load
- **🚀 Progressive Difficulty** - Guided practice moves from scaffolded to independent problems
- **💻 Optional Coding** - Python notebooks are enriching but not required
- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Parent-Friendly** - Answer keys include teaching tips and "fix-it" advice
