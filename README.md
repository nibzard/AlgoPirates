# Summer Math + Python Sprint 🧠💻

**A printable, device-light summer math program for rising 5th graders that blends core paper-based math fluency with fun, beginner-friendly Python activities in Google Colab.**

---

## 🌟 Overview

This open-source project provides a full **8-week, 40-session** summer preparation course for students entering 5th grade. Each session is centered around:

- **Math-first, paper-based tasks** aligned with international grade-level standards.
- **Optional Python coding tasks**, using Google Colab, that mirror or extend the math concepts.
- **Minimal parent supervision required** – just print and go!
- **No Minecraft or specialized software needed** – runs in any browser via Colab.

Designed to bridge traditional math fluency with modern computational thinking, the program builds confidence and enjoyment in both subjects.

## ✍️ Structure

### 📁 `weeks/`
This folder contains 8 subfolders, one for each week:

weeks/
├── week1_number_sense/
│   ├── W1_Day1_Sheet.pdf
│   ├── W1_Day1_Answers.pdf
│   ├── W1_Day3_Colab.ipynb
│   └── …
├── week2_fractions/
│   ├── …
…

- **`Sheet.pdf`** – The printable A4 worksheet (1 page/day).
- **`Answers.pdf`** – Parent-friendly answer key with tips.
- **`.ipynb` files** – Optional Python notebooks to open in Google Colab.

---

### 📁 `colab_tasks/`
A flat directory of all 10 Python notebooks used in the program, for quick access or preview.

colab_tasks/
├── tower_blocks.ipynb
├── fraction_wall.ipynb
├── life_sim.py
…

Each notebook is beginner-friendly (≤20 lines) and includes comments and TODOs for learners to fill in.

## 📌 Goals

1. **Math Mastery** – Prepare students for 5th-grade concepts through structured, example-based worksheets.
2. **Gentle Python Intro** – Introduce loops, functions, logic, and basic data structures in an age-appropriate way.
3. **Low Barrier to Entry** – Use only paper and free tools (like Google Colab); zero proprietary software required.

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. **Print all PDFs from the `weeks/` folders** – or just one week at a time.
2. **Start Day 1 on a Monday** – 15–45 min/day.
3. **Optionally open the `.ipynb` notebooks on Colab** during “Code Days.”
4. **Track progress using the Progress Tracker.**
5. **Check answers using the included keys.**

No technical background required for adults. Code notebooks are optional—but exciting!
