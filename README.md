## üåü Overview

This open-source project provides a full **8-week, 40-session** summer preparation course for students entering 5th grade. Each session is centered around:

- **Math-first, paper-based tasks** aligned with international grade-level standards
- **Optional Python coding tasks**, using Google Colab, that mirror or extend the math concepts
- **Minimal parent supervision required** ‚Äì just print and go!
- **No Minecraft or specialized software needed** ‚Äì runs in any browser via Colab

Designed to bridge traditional math fluency with modern computational thinking, the program builds confidence and enjoyment in both subjects.

### ‚ú® What Makes This Special

- **üìÑ Print-and-Go Worksheets** - Each day's activity fits on one A4 page with clear instructions
- **üéØ Worked Examples First** - Every worksheet starts with a detailed example to reduce cognitive load
- **üöÄ Progressive Difficulty** - Guided practice moves from scaffolded to independent problems
- **üíª Optional Coding** - Python notebooks are enriching but not required
- **üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Parent-Friendly** - Answer keys include teaching tips and "fix-it" advice

## üìå Goals

1. **Math Mastery** ‚Äì Prepare students for 5th-grade concepts through structured, example-based worksheets.
2. **Gentle Python Intro** ‚Äì Introduce loops, functions, logic, and basic data structures in an age-appropriate way.
3. **Low Barrier to Entry** ‚Äì Use only paper and free tools (like Google Colab); zero proprietary software required.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Use

1. **Print all PDFs from the `weeks/` folders** ‚Äì or just one week at a time.
2. **Start Day 1 on a Monday** ‚Äì 15‚Äì45 min/day.
3. **Optionally open the `.ipynb` notebooks on Colab** during ‚ÄúCode Days.‚Äù
4. **Track progress using the Progress Tracker.**
5. **Check answers using the included keys.**

No technical background required for adults. Code notebooks are optional‚Äîbut exciting!
