# Week 7 Day 3 – Intro Variables

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Solve $2x = 10$ using inverse operations.

$2x = 10$

Divide both sides by 2 → $x = 5$

## Guided Practice
1. $x + 6 = 11$ → $x =$ ____
2. $3x = 9$ → $x =$ ____
3. $x - 4 = 1$ → $x =$ ____
4. $x / 5 = 3$ → $x =$ ____
5. $2x + 1 = 7$ → $x =$ ____

## Challenge
6. $5x = 45$ → $x =$ ____
7. $x/4 + 2 = 5$ → $x =$ ____
8. How can you check if your answer to $x - 4 = 1$ is correct?

## Stretch / Colab
Use `cube_maker.ipynb` to practice assigning and updating variables.

## Exit Ticket
Create a one-step equation for a friend to solve.

### Paper Fallback
On the back: Draw a balance scale to show how equations stay equal.
