# W7 Day 3: Solving Simple Equations

⏱ **Duration:** 45 minutes

---

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Solving One-Step Equations**

Equation: **x + 7 = 15**

**Step 1:** Ask yourself: "What number plus 7 equals 15?"
**Step 2:** Use inverse operations - since we're adding 7, we subtract 7
**Step 3:** Subtract 7 from both sides:
```
x + 7 = 15
x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7
x = 8
```
**Step 4:** Check: 8 + 7 = 15 ✓

**Another example:** **3y = 21**
Since we're multiplying by 3, we divide by 3:
```
3y = 21
3y ÷ 3 = 21 ÷ 3
y = 7
```
Check: 3 × 7 = 21 ✓
