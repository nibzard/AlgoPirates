**Solving Mystery Number Problems**

Problem: "I'm thinking of a number. When I add 5 to it, I get 12. What's my number?"

**Step 1:** Let's call the mystery number **n**
**Step 2:** Write what we know: n + 5 = 12
**Step 3:** To find n, we ask: "What plus 5 equals 12?"
**Step 4:** We can subtract 5 from both sides: n = 12 - 5
**Step 5:** Therefore: n = 7

**Check:** 7 + 5 = 12 ✓
