# W7 Day 5: Variables in Geometry - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Square formulas:** A square has side length **s** cm.
   - Perimeter = **4s**
   - Area = **s¬≤** (or s √ó s)
   - If s = 5 cm, then Perimeter = **20 cm** and Area = **25 cm¬≤**

**Teaching Tip:** Help students see that **s** represents ANY side length, making our formulas flexible. "Whether the square is tiny or huge, we always add up 4 sides for perimeter and multiply side √ó side for area." Practice with different values to show how variables make formulas work for any size.

**2. Triangle problem:** A triangle has a base of **b** units and height of 3 units.
   - Area = ¬Ω √ó base √ó height = **¬Ω √ó b √ó 3 = 1.5b** (or 3b/2)
   - If b = 8 units, then Area = **12 square units**

**Teaching Tip:** Emphasize that the height stays constant (3 units) but the base varies (b units). This creates an expression where area depends on the base length. Connect to real shapes: "If I have a triangular garden bed that's always 3 feet tall, how does the area change as I make the base wider or narrower?"

**3. Pattern blocks:** If one hexagon has area **H**, then:
   - 3 hexagons have area = **3H**
   - 10 hexagons have area = **10H**

**Teaching Tip:** This introduces students to coefficient thinking. "The number in front of H tells us how many hexagons we have." Use actual pattern blocks or drawings to make this concrete: "If I don't know the exact area of one hexagon, I can still describe the total area of multiple hexagons."

**4. Real garden:** A rectangular vegetable patch is 3 times as long as it is wide. If the width is **w** feet:
   - Length = **3w**
   - Perimeter = **2w + 2(3w) = 2w + 6w = 8w**

**Teaching Tip:** Break this down step by step. "First, what's the length? 3 times the width, so 3w. Next, what's perimeter? Add all four sides: w + w + 3w + 3w." Show how to combine like terms: "Two w's plus two 3w's equals 2w + 6w = 8w." This reinforces both geometric formulas and algebraic simplification.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Notes

The Colab notebook will help students create a calculator that can compute area and perimeter for rectangles and squares given any dimensions, demonstrating how variables make formulas flexible and reusable.

## Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** A rectangle has width w and length 2w. Write expressions for its perimeter and area.

**Sample Student Response:** "The width is w and length is 2w. For perimeter, I add all sides: w + 2w + w + 2w = 6w. For area, I multiply length times width: 2w √ó w = 2w¬≤. If w = 4, then perimeter = 24 and area = 32 square units."

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

‚Ä¢ **Common Mistakes:** Students often forget that variables can represent measurements with units (like "w feet" or "s cm"). Remind them that when they substitute numbers, they should include appropriate units in their final answers.

‚Ä¢ **Visual Support:** Draw shapes on graph paper or use manipulatives like blocks or tiles. Let students build rectangles where one dimension changes while exploring how perimeter and area change. This makes abstract algebraic expressions feel concrete and meaningful.

‚Ä¢ **Real-World Connections:** Connect to home projects: measuring rooms for carpet, planning garden beds, or determining how much fencing is needed. Ask "If we don't know the exact measurements yet, how can we still plan and calculate?"

## üîß Troubleshooting

‚Ä¢ **If students struggle with substituting values...** Try this: Create a substitution checklist. "Step 1: Circle the variable. Step 2: Replace every variable with the given number. Step 3: Follow order of operations. Step 4: Include units." Practice with simple expressions before complex geometric formulas.

‚Ä¢ **If students confuse perimeter and area formulas...** Try this: Use memory tricks. "Perimeter is the fence around the outside - we ADD the sides. Area is the space inside - we MULTIPLY length times width." Have them trace perimeters with their finger and shade areas with colored pencils.

‚Ä¢ **If students can't connect variables to geometry...** Try this: Start with specific numbers, then generalize. "This square has sides of 3 cm, so perimeter is 12 cm. This square has sides of 7 cm, so perimeter is 28 cm. What if the sides are s cm? Then perimeter is 4s cm." Build the pattern recognition first.
