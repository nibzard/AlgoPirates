# W7 Day 5: Variables in Geometry - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Square formulas:** A square has side length **s** cm.
   - Perimeter = **4s**
   - Area = **s²** (or s × s)
   - If s = 5 cm, then Perimeter = **20 cm** and Area = **25 cm²**

**2. Triangle problem:** A triangle has a base of **b** units and height of 3 units.
   - Area = ½ × base × height = **½ × b × 3 = 1.5b** (or 3b/2)
   - If b = 8 units, then Area = **12 square units**

**3. Pattern blocks:** If one hexagon has area **H**, then:
   - 3 hexagons have area = **3H**
   - 10 hexagons have area = **10H**

**4. Real garden:** A rectangular vegetable patch is 3 times as long as it is wide. If the width is **w** feet:
   - Length = **3w**
   - Perimeter = **2w + 2(3w) = 2w + 6w = 8w**

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Notes

The Colab notebook will help students create a calculator that can compute area and perimeter for rectangles and squares given any dimensions, demonstrating how variables make formulas flexible and reusable.

## 💡 Teaching Tips

- Connect algebraic thinking to familiar geometric concepts
- Use manipulatives or graph paper to make abstract formulas concrete
- Emphasize that variables allow us to create general rules that work for any size shape
- Practice substituting different values to see how the expressions change
- Relate to real-world applications like planning gardens, rooms, or playgrounds
