# W7 Day 4: Balance Scale Problems

⏱ **Duration:** 30 minutes

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Understanding Equation Balance**

Imagine a balance scale that's perfectly level:

```
[3 + x] ⚖️ [10]
```

**Step 1:** For the scale to balance, both sides must be equal
**Step 2:** This means: 3 + x = 10
**Step 3:** To keep it balanced, if we remove 3 from the left side, we must remove 3 from the right side:
```
[x] ⚖️ [10 - 3]
[x] ⚖️ [7]
```
**Step 4:** Therefore: x = 7

**The golden rule:** Whatever you do to one side of the scale, you must do to the other side to keep it balanced!
