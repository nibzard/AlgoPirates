# W7 Day 1: Mystery Number Puzzles - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Mystery number:** When I subtract 3 from my number, I get 8.
   - Let my number = n
   - Write the equation: **n - 3 = 8**
   - Solve: n = **11**

**Teaching Tip:** Guide students through the "inverse operation" thinking: "If n - 3 = 8, then I need to 'undo' the subtraction by adding 3 to both sides: n = 8 + 3 = 11." Always check: "Does 11 - 3 = 8? Yes!" Use the balance scale metaphor: keep both sides equal.

**2. Another puzzle:** My number times 4 equals 20.
   - Write the equation: **n √ó 4 = 20** (or 4n = 20)
   - My number is: **5**

**Teaching Tip:** Show the inverse relationship: "If 4n = 20, I undo multiplication with division: n = 20 √∑ 4 = 5." Connect to known facts: "What times 4 equals 20?" Many students will recognize this from multiplication tables. Check: "Does 5 √ó 4 = 20? Yes!"

**3. Create your own:** Sample problems where the answer is 15:
   - "My number plus 7 equals 22" (n + 7 = 22)
   - "When I subtract 5 from my number, I get 10" (n - 5 = 10)
   - "My number times 3 equals 45" (3n = 45)

**Teaching Tip:** Encourage creativity while maintaining mathematical accuracy. Have students trade puzzles with partners and solve them. This builds both writing and solving skills. Remind them to always check their created problems work correctly.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

Students might create puzzles like:
- "Double my number and add 1 to get 11" (2n + 1 = 11, so n = 5)
- "Half my number equals 6" (n √∑ 2 = 6, so n = 12)
- "My number minus 8 equals 0" (n - 8 = 0, so n = 8)

**Teaching Tip:** If students create multi-step problems, guide them to solve step-by-step. For "double my number and add 1 to get 11": first subtract 1 from both sides (2n = 10), then divide by 2 (n = 5).

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Create a mystery number puzzle where the answer is 12.

**Sample Answers:** 
- "My number plus 4 equals 16" (n + 4 = 16)
- "When I multiply my number by 2, I get 24" (2n = 24)
- "My number minus 7 equals 5" (n - 7 = 5)

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Common Mistake:** Children may guess and check instead of using systematic solving. Encourage them to "undo" operations: if the problem adds 5, they should subtract 5 to solve.
- **Visual Support:** Use a balance scale or draw one. Show that whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other to keep it balanced.
- **Real-World Connections:** "I'm thinking of my age. In 5 years I'll be 18. How old am I now?" Connect to familiar number relationships.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Understanding what a variable represents
**Try this:** Start with concrete examples: "Let's call the mystery number 'box.' If box - 3 = 8, what number goes in the box?" Use actual boxes or containers with numbers inside.

**If students struggle with:** Inverse operations
**Try this:** Practice with known facts first: "8 + 5 = 13, so 13 - 5 = ?" Help them see that addition and subtraction are opposites, multiplication and division are opposites.

**If students struggle with:** Checking their answers
**Try this:** Make checking a fun ritual. "Let's be detectives and see if our answer solves the mystery!" Substitute their answer back into the original problem and verify it works.
