# W7 Day 5: Variables in Geometry

⏱ **Duration:** 45 minutes

---

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Using Variables for Geometric Formulas**

**Rectangle Problem:** A rectangular garden has a length of **L** meters and a width of 4 meters.

**Finding Perimeter:**
- Perimeter = 2 × length + 2 × width
- Perimeter = 2L + 2(4)
- Perimeter = 2L + 8 meters

**Finding Area:**
- Area = length × width  
- Area = L × 4
- Area = 4L square meters

**If L = 6 meters:**
- Perimeter = 2(6) + 8 = 20 meters
- Area = 4(6) = 24 square meters

## 📝 Guided Practice

**1. Square formulas:** A square has side length **s** cm.
   - Perimeter = _____
   - Area = _____
   - If s = 5 cm, then Perimeter = _____ and Area = _____

**2. Triangle problem:** A triangle has a base of **b** units and height of 3 units.
   - Area = ½ × base × height = _____
   - If b = 8 units, then Area = _____

**3. Pattern blocks:** If one hexagon has area **H**, then:
   - 3 hexagons have area = _____
   - 10 hexagons have area = _____

**4. Real garden:** A rectangular vegetable patch is 3 times as long as it is wide. If the width is **w** feet:
   - Length = _____
   - Perimeter = _____

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Open today's notebook and create a "shape calculator" that finds area and perimeter for any size rectangle or square.

**Paper Fallback:** Design a "Geometry Detective" worksheet where students find missing dimensions of shapes using given perimeters or areas.
