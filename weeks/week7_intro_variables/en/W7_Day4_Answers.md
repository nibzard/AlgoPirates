# W7 Day 4: Balance Scale Problems - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Balance these scales:**
   ```
   [y + 5] ‚öñÔ∏è [13]    ‚Üí    [y] ‚öñÔ∏è [8]
   ```

**Teaching Tip:** Emphasize that the scale picture shows exactly what we do algebraically. "To keep the scale balanced, if I remove 5 from the left side, I must remove 5 from the right side too." This visual makes the abstract concept of inverse operations concrete and memorable.

**2. What operation keeps this balanced?**
   ```
   [2m] ‚öñÔ∏è [16]    ‚Üí    [m] ‚öñÔ∏è [8]
   ```
   Operation used: **Divide both sides by 2**

**Teaching Tip:** Help students see that 2m means "2 groups of m" or "m doubled." To undo doubling, we halve both sides. Use the analogy: "If two boxes contain the same as 16 items, then one box contains 8 items." This connects multiplication/division to grouping concepts they understand.

**3. Real-world balance:** 
   A scale has 4 apples plus some mystery weight on one side, and 12 apples on the other side. The mystery weight equals **8** apples.
   (Equation: 4 + x = 12, so x = 8)

**Teaching Tip:** This problem bridges concrete (apples) and abstract (variables). Ask students to visualize the actual scale: "What would make 4 apples plus something equal to 12 apples?" This helps them see that algebra describes real situations they can imagine and understand.

**4. Draw your own:** Sample drawing for n - 3 = 8:
   ```
   [Box with n - 3] ‚öñÔ∏è [8 objects]
   ```

**Teaching Tip:** Drawing equations helps students transition from concrete to abstract thinking. Encourage creativity - they might draw actual objects, boxes with expressions, or simple geometric shapes. The key is that their drawing shows the balance concept clearly.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Examples

**Balance Scale Game Ideas:**
- Use coins, blocks, or toys as weights
- Present scenarios like "3 red blocks + mystery box = 7 blue blocks"
- Include multi-step balancing challenges

## Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Draw a balance scale for the equation 3x = 15 and show how to solve it.

**Sample Student Response:** "I drew [3x] ‚öñÔ∏è [15]. To solve it, I need to divide both sides by 3, so [3x √∑ 3] ‚öñÔ∏è [15 √∑ 3], which gives me [x] ‚öñÔ∏è [5]. I can check: 3 √ó 5 = 15. ‚úì"

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

‚Ä¢ **Common Mistakes:** Students often want to "move" numbers without doing the same operation to both sides. Remind them that scales tip if we only change one side. Always ask "What did we do to the left? Now what must we do to the right?"

‚Ä¢ **Visual Support:** Use a real balance scale, seesaw, or even a ruler balanced on a pencil. Place identical objects on both sides, then show how removing or adding to one side requires the same change to the other side to maintain balance.

‚Ä¢ **Real-World Connections:** Point out balance in daily life: "If you and your sibling sit on opposite sides of a seesaw, what happens if one person gets off?" Connect this to equation solving - both sides must stay "balanced" or equal.

## üîß Troubleshooting

‚Ä¢ **If students struggle with the balance concept...** Try this: Start with a physical demonstration. Use a coat hanger as a balance with bags or containers. Add/remove items to show how balance works, then connect this to equation symbols.

‚Ä¢ **If students apply operations to only one side...** Try this: Always use the phrase "Do the same thing to both sides." Make it a chant or song. Before they write anything, have them say what they'll do to BOTH sides.

‚Ä¢ **If students can't visualize balance scales...** Try this: Use the "friendship bracelet" analogy - two friends must have the same number of beads to be fair. If we give one friend 3 more beads, we must give the other friend 3 more beads too. This fairness concept mirrors equation balance.
