# W7 Day 4: Balance Scale Problems - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Answers

**1. Balance these scales:**
   ```
   [y + 5] ‚öñÔ∏è [13]    ‚Üí    [y] ‚öñÔ∏è [8]
   ```

**2. What operation keeps this balanced?**
   ```
   [2m] ‚öñÔ∏è [16]    ‚Üí    [m] ‚öñÔ∏è [8]
   ```
   Operation used: **Divide both sides by 2**

**3. Real-world balance:** 
   A scale has 4 apples plus some mystery weight on one side, and 12 apples on the other side. The mystery weight equals **8** apples.
   (Equation: 4 + x = 12, so x = 8)

**4. Draw your own:** Sample drawing for n - 3 = 8:
   ```
   [Box with n - 3] ‚öñÔ∏è [8 objects]
   ```

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Examples

**Balance Scale Game Ideas:**
- Use coins, blocks, or toys as weights
- Present scenarios like "3 red blocks + mystery box = 7 blue blocks"
- Include multi-step balancing challenges

## üí° Teaching Tips

- Use actual balance scales or see-saws if available for hands-on learning
- Emphasize that equations are like balanced scales - both sides must be equal
- Connect the abstract concept to physical experiences students can relate to
- Practice with concrete objects before moving to purely symbolic equations
- Highlight that the "balance" rule prevents us from changing the equation's meaning
