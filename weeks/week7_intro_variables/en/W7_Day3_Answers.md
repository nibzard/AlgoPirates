# W7 Day 3: Solving Simple Equations - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Solve these equations:**
   - a + 4 = 11    →    a = **7**
   - b - 6 = 9     →    b = **15**
   - 5c = 30       →    c = **6**

**2. Check your answers:**
   - Does 7 + 4 = 11? **Yes**
   - Does 15 - 6 = 9? **Yes**
   - Does 5 × 6 = 30? **Yes**

**3. Word problem:** Maria has some stickers. After giving away 8 stickers, she has 12 left. How many did she start with?
   - Equation: s - 8 = 12
   - Solution: s = **20**

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Examples

**Easy (3rd grade):** x + 2 = 5, y - 1 = 3
**Medium (4th grade):** 4a = 12, b ÷ 2 = 7
**Challenging (5th grade):** 2x + 1 = 9, 3y - 4 = 8

## 💡 Teaching Tips

- Emphasize the "balance" concept - what you do to one side, you must do to the other
- Encourage students to always check their answers by substituting back
- Use physical balance scales or see-saw analogies to make the concept concrete
- Start with addition/subtraction before moving to multiplication/division
- Connect to real-world situations to make equations meaningful
