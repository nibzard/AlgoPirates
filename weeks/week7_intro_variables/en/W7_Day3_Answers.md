# W7 Day 3: Solving Simple Equations - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Solve these equations:**
   - a + 4 = 11    ‚Üí    a = **7**
   - b - 6 = 9     ‚Üí    b = **15**
   - 5c = 30       ‚Üí    c = **6**

**Teaching Tip:** Use the balance scale analogy - "What you do to one side, you must do to the other." For a + 4 = 11, subtract 4 from both sides. For 5c = 30, divide both sides by 5. This maintains equality while isolating the variable.

**2. Check your answers:**
   - Does 7 + 4 = 11? **Yes**
   - Does 15 - 6 = 9? **Yes**
   - Does 5 √ó 6 = 30? **Yes**

**Teaching Tip:** Always emphasize substitution checking. This builds confidence and helps students catch errors. Model saying "Let me check: if a = 7, then 7 + 4 equals 11. That matches the right side, so my answer is correct!"

**3. Word problem:** Maria has some stickers. After giving away 8 stickers, she has 12 left. How many did she start with?
   - Equation: s - 8 = 12
   - Solution: s = **20**

**Teaching Tip:** Help students identify the variable first ("What are we trying to find?") then translate the story. "Some stickers" becomes our variable s. "After giving away 8" means subtract 8. "Has 12 left" gives us the final result. This systematic approach prevents confusion.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Examples

**Easy (3rd grade):** x + 2 = 5, y - 1 = 3
**Medium (4th grade):** 4a = 12, b √∑ 2 = 7
**Challenging (5th grade):** 2x + 1 = 9, 3y - 4 = 8

## Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Solve: x + 7 = 15

**Sample Student Response:** "I need to find what number plus 7 equals 15. I can subtract 7 from both sides: x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7, so x = 8. Let me check: 8 + 7 = 15. ‚úì"

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

‚Ä¢ **Common Mistakes:** Watch for students who change only one side of the equation (like writing x = 15 - 7 without showing both sides). Remind them that equations are like balanced scales - whatever we do to one side must be done to the other.

‚Ä¢ **Visual Support:** Use a see-saw or balance scale analogy. If one side gets heavier (we add something), the other side must get equally heavier to stay balanced. Draw this concept or use actual household items on a kitchen scale.

‚Ä¢ **Real-World Connections:** Connect to everyday scenarios: "If you have some money, spend $8, and have $12 left, how much did you start with?" This helps students see that algebra solves practical problems they encounter.

## üîß Troubleshooting

‚Ä¢ **If students struggle with inverse operations...** Try this: Start with simple mental math. "If x + 3 = 8, what plus 3 equals 8?" Once they say "5," explain that subtraction is the inverse of addition. Practice with concrete numbers before using variables.

‚Ä¢ **If students forget to check their answers...** Try this: Make checking a habit by always saying "Let's prove we're right!" Show them that substitution is like being a detective - we're testing our solution to see if it works in the original equation.

‚Ä¢ **If students can't translate word problems...** Try this: Use the "Find, Set up, Solve, Check" method. Find what we're looking for, set up the equation by translating each part of the story, solve using inverse operations, then check by substituting back into the original problem.
