# W7 Day 2: Writing Expressions with Variables - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

Let **y** represent the number of books Sarah has.

**1. Translate to expressions:**
   - "3 more books than Sarah" = **y + 3**
   - "Sarah's books minus 2" = **y - 2**
   - "Triple Sarah's books" = **3y**

**2. Word problems to expressions:**
   - Emma has 5 stickers. Tom has **n** stickers. Together they have **5 + n** stickers.
   - A rectangle has length **L**. Its width is 4 cm shorter. The width = **L - 4**

**3. Create expressions:** Let **z** = your favorite number. Write expressions for:
   - Ten more than your favorite number: **z + 10**
   - Your favorite number times itself: **z × z** (or z²)

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Examples

**Sample Variable Story:**
"Alex has **x** baseball cards. His sister has 5 more cards than Alex, which means she has **x + 5** cards. Their cousin has twice as many as Alex, so he has **2x** cards."

## 💡 Teaching Tips

- Start with familiar contexts (age, money, toys) before moving to abstract concepts
- Emphasize the importance of defining what each variable represents
- Practice translating from math expressions back to words
- Show that expressions are like formulas that work for any value of the variable
