# W7 Day 2: Writing Expressions with Variables - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

Let **y** represent the number of books Sarah has.

**1. Translate to expressions:**
   - "3 more books than Sarah" = **y + 3**
   - "Sarah's books minus 2" = **y - 2**
   - "Triple Sarah's books" = **3y**

**Teaching Tip:** Help students identify key words: "more than" means addition, "minus" means subtraction, "triple" means multiply by 3. Practice reading expressions aloud: "y + 3 means 'y plus 3' or 'three more than y.'" Use consistent language to build pattern recognition.

**2. Word problems to expressions:**
   - Emma has 5 stickers. Tom has **n** stickers. Together they have **5 + n** stickers.
   - A rectangle has length **L**. Its width is 4 cm shorter. The width = **L - 4**

**Teaching Tip:** Show students to identify what's known (5 stickers, 4 cm shorter) versus unknown (n stickers, length L). Model the thinking: "Together means we add what Emma has plus what Tom has: 5 + n." For geometry, "shorter" means subtract: L - 4.

**3. Create expressions:** Let **z** = your favorite number. Write expressions for:
   - Ten more than your favorite number: **z + 10**
   - Your favorite number times itself: **z √ó z** (or z¬≤)

**Teaching Tip:** Let students pick their actual favorite number and substitute it to check their expressions. If z = 7, then "ten more" becomes 7 + 10 = 17. This concrete substitution helps verify their abstract expressions are correct.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample Variable Story:**
"Alex has **x** baseball cards. His sister has 5 more cards than Alex, which means she has **x + 5** cards. Their cousin has twice as many as Alex, so he has **2x** cards."

**Teaching Tip:** Have students create stories with specific numbers first (Alex has 10 cards, sister has 15, cousin has 20), then replace the specific number with a variable. This bridges concrete to abstract thinking.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Let **m** = the number of minutes you spent on homework. Write expressions for: a) 15 minutes more than that, b) Half that time.

**Sample Answers:** 
a) 15 minutes more = **m + 15**
b) Half that time = **m √∑ 2** (or m/2)

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Common Mistake:** Children may confuse the order in subtraction. "5 less than n" is n - 5, not 5 - n. Practice with concrete examples: "5 less than 10 apples is 10 - 5 = 5 apples."
- **Visual Support:** Use physical objects. If n represents toys, show "3 more toys" by adding 3 objects to the pile.
- **Real-World Connections:** "If you have x dollars and earn 5 more, you'll have x + 5 dollars." Use familiar contexts like allowance, age, or toys.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Key word identification (more, less, times, etc.)
**Try this:** Create a word wall with math operation keywords. Practice with simple examples: "3 more than 5" = 5 + 3 = 8. Build familiarity before using variables.

**If students struggle with:** Order in subtraction expressions
**Try this:** Use the phrase "take away from." "5 less than n" means "take 5 away from n," which is n - 5. Act it out with physical objects.

**If students struggle with:** Understanding variables as unknowns
**Try this:** Start with boxes or containers: "The box contains some marbles. 3 more than what's in the box." Then replace "what's in the box" with a variable letter.
