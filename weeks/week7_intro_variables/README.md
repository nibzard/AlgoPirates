# Week 7 â€“ Intro Variables

This week introduces students to algebraic thinking through variables, expressions, and simple equations. Students learn to represent unknown quantities with letters, write mathematical expressions, and solve one-step equations using balance concepts. The optional Python notebook `cube_maker.ipynb` demonstrates how variables work in programming and geometry. Each day has a printable worksheet (`Sheet.md`) and answer key (`Answers.md`).
