# Week 1 â€“ Number Sense

This week introduces place value and quick multiplication review. Each day includes a Markdown worksheet (`Sheet.md`) and a matching answer key (`Answers.md`). Short "Challenge" sections stretch learners with extra practice. Day 3 has an optional Colab notebook, `tower_blocks.ipynb`, to explore loops. Use the fallback task printed on the back if you don't have a device. PDFs can be generated from the Markdown files using the future build script.
