# W1 Day 2: Multi-Digit Multiplication Strategies

⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Breaking Apart Numbers to Multiply**

Let's solve **23 × 4** using the distributive property:

**Step 1:** Break 23 into place value parts
23 = 20 + 3

**Step 2:** Distribute the multiplication
23 × 4 = (20 + 3) × 4 = (20 × 4) + (3 × 4)

**Step 3:** Calculate each part
- 20 × 4 = 80
- 3 × 4 = 12

**Step 4:** Add the results
80 + 12 = 92

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Breaking numbers apart makes multiplication easier because we can use facts we already know well.

## 📝 Guided Practice

**1. Use the break-apart method:**
41 × 6 = (40 + 1) × 6 = _____ + _____ = _____

**2. Try this strategy:**
68 × 5 = (_____ + _____) × 5 = _____ + _____ = _____

**3. Challenge yourself:**
27 × 7 = _____
Show your work using place value.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Open `tower_blocks.ipynb` and modify the code to create visual models of multiplication problems.

**Paper Fallback:** Draw an area model (rectangle) to show 32 × 3. Divide the rectangle to show (30 × 3) + (2 × 3).

## 🎯 Exit Ticket

Why does breaking apart 98 × 6 as (100 - 2) × 6 = 600 - 12 = 588 work?
