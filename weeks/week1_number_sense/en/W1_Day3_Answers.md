# W1 Day 3: Division with Remainders - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Practice with remainders:**
75 √∑ 6 = **12 r3**
Check: **12** √ó 6 + **3** = 75

**Step-by-step solution:**
- How many 6s in 75? Start with estimates: 6 √ó 10 = 60, 6 √ó 12 = 72, 6 √ó 13 = 78 (too big)
- So we can make 12 groups of 6
- 75 - 72 = 3 remainder
- Check: 12 √ó 6 + 3 = 72 + 3 = 75 ‚úì

**Teaching Tip:** Encourage students to use multiplication facts they know well as stepping stones. If they know 6 √ó 10 = 60, they can build up: 6 √ó 11 = 66, 6 √ó 12 = 72.

**2. Try this one:**
99 √∑ 8 = **12 r3**

**Step-by-step solution:**
- Estimate: 8 √ó 10 = 80, 8 √ó 12 = 96, 8 √ó 13 = 104 (too big)
- We can make 12 groups of 8
- 99 - 96 = 3 remainder
- Check: 12 √ó 8 + 3 = 96 + 3 = 99 ‚úì

**Teaching Tip:** Point out patterns! Both problems 1 and 2 have the same quotient (12) and remainder (3). This is coincidental but helps students see how division works systematically.

**3. Larger numbers:**
132 √∑ 5 = **26 r2**

**Step-by-step solution:**
- Think: 5 √ó 20 = 100, 5 √ó 25 = 125, 5 √ó 26 = 130, 5 √ó 27 = 135 (too big)
- We can make 26 groups of 5
- 132 - 130 = 2 remainder
- Check: 26 √ó 5 + 2 = 130 + 2 = 132 ‚úì

**Teaching Tip:** For larger numbers, encourage students to use benchmark multiplications (like √ó 10, √ó 20) and build from there rather than counting up by ones.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Explain why checking 58 √∑ 4 = 14 r2 with multiplication (14 √ó 4 + 2) proves our answer is correct.

**Sample Answer:** Division and multiplication are inverse operations - they "undo" each other. When we check 58 √∑ 4 = 14 r2 by calculating 14 √ó 4 + 2, we're rebuilding the original number. If 14 √ó 4 + 2 = 58, then we know we correctly found how many groups of 4 fit into 58 (14 groups) and what's left over (2). It's like checking subtraction with addition.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Real-World Context:** Use sharing scenarios. "We have 75 stickers to share equally among 6 friends. Each friend gets 12 stickers, and we have 3 left over."
- **Visual Models:** Use objects like beans, coins, or drawings. Actually divide 75 items into 6 groups to see the remainder.
- **Estimation First:** Before calculating exactly, ask "About how many groups do you think we can make?" This builds number sense.
- **Always Check:** Make checking with multiplication + remainder a habit. It catches errors and reinforces the relationship between operations.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Finding the quotient (how many groups)
**Try this:** Start with easier multiples they know. For 75 √∑ 6, if they know 6 √ó 10 = 60, they know the answer is at least 10. Then try 6 √ó 11, 6 √ó 12, etc.

**If students struggle with:** Understanding what remainders mean
**Try this:** Use concrete examples. "If 15 cookies are shared among 4 people, each person gets 3 cookies and there's 3 left over - that's the remainder."

**If students struggle with:** The checking step
**Try this:** Show the connection explicitly: "Division asks 'How many groups?' and multiplication answers 'Let me rebuild those groups to check.'"

**If students struggle with:** Larger division problems
**Try this:** Break them down using partial quotients:
```
132 √∑ 5
5 √ó 20 = 100  ‚Üí  32 remaining
5 √ó 6 = 30    ‚Üí  2 remaining
20 + 6 = 26 r2
```
