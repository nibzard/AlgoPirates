# W1 Day 3: Division with Remainders

⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Understanding Division with Remainders**

Let's solve **58 ÷ 4** step by step:

**Step 1:** How many groups of 4 can we make from 58?
- 4 × 10 = 40 (we can make at least 10 groups)
- 4 × 14 = 56 (we can make 14 groups)
- 4 × 15 = 60 (too big!)

**Step 2:** Find the remainder
58 - 56 = 2 left over

**Step 3:** Write the answer
58 ÷ 4 = 14 remainder 2 (or 14 r2)

**Check:** 14 × 4 + 2 = 56 + 2 = 58 ✓

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Division tells us how to share equally, and remainders show what's left over.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Open `tower_blocks.ipynb` and modify the loop to count down by 4s instead of up. What remainder patterns do you notice?

**Paper Fallback:** Create a word problem where 86 ÷ 7 represents sharing items equally among friends. What happens to the leftover items?
