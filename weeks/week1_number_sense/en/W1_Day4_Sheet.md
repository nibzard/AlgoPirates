## 🔍 Worked Example

**Rounding Numbers to Make Estimation Easier**

Let's round **4,382** to the nearest hundred:

**Step 1:** Find the place we're rounding to
4,382 → Look at the hundreds place (3)

**Step 2:** Look at the digit to the right
The tens digit is 8

**Step 3:** Apply the rounding rule
- If the digit is 5 or more, round up
- If the digit is 4 or less, round down
- Since 8 ≥ 5, we round up

**Step 4:** Write the result
4,382 ≈ 4,400

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Rounding helps us estimate quickly and check if our exact answers make sense.
