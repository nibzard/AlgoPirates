## üîç Worked Example

**Solving Missing Factor Problems**

Let's solve: **4 √ó ? = 36**

**Step 1:** Understand what we're looking for
We need a number that, when multiplied by 4, gives us 36

**Step 2:** Use the inverse relationship
Since multiplication and division are inverse operations:
4 √ó ? = 36 means ? = 36 √∑ 4

**Step 3:** Calculate
36 √∑ 4 = 9

**Step 4:** Check our answer
4 √ó 9 = 36 ‚úì

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** When we know two parts of a multiplication fact, we can always find the third part using division.
