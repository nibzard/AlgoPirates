# W1 Day 1: Place Value Tower Blocks - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Break down these numbers:** 
845 = **8** hundreds + **4** tens + **5** ones

**Teaching Tip:** Use physical base-10 blocks or drawings to help visual learners see the place value. Have students point to each digit while saying its place value name.

**2. Larger numbers:**
1,249 = **1** thousand + **2** hundreds + **4** tens + **9** ones

**Teaching Tip:** For numbers with thousands, emphasize the comma placement. Students often struggle with the thousands place, so practice reading numbers aloud: "one thousand, two hundred forty-nine."

**3. Challenge yourself:**
Write 9,600 in expanded form: **9,000** + **600** + **0** + **0**

**Teaching Tip:** Point out that zeros are placeholders - they show that there are no tens or ones, but we still need to acknowledge these place values exist.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Explain why the digit 5 in the number 507 represents 500, not just 5.

**Sample Answer:** The digit 5 is in the hundreds place, so it represents 5 groups of 100, which equals 500. The position of a digit determines its value - the same digit 5 would only equal 5 if it were in the ones place.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Common Mistake:** Students may confuse the digit with its value. Practice saying "5 hundreds equals 500" to reinforce this concept.
- **Visual Support:** Draw place value charts or use household items (pennies for ones, dimes for tens, dollar bills for hundreds).
- **Real-World Connections:** Use money examples - "How many $100 bills would you need to make $500?"

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Place value positions
**Try this:** Use a place value mat and have them physically move digits to different positions to see how the value changes.

**If students struggle with:** Numbers with zeros
**Try this:** Emphasize that zero means "none of that place value" - like having zero tens but still needing to show the tens place exists.
