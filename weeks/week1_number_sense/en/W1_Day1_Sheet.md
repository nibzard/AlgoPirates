## 🔍 Worked Example

**Understanding Place Value with Numbers**

Let's break down the number **372**:

**Step 1:** Identify each digit and its position
- 3 is in the **hundreds** place
- 7 is in the **tens** place  
- 2 is in the **ones** place

**Step 2:** Express each place value
- 3 hundreds = 300
- 7 tens = 70
- 2 ones = 2

**Step 3:** Verify by addition
372 = 300 + 70 + 2 ✓

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** When we decompose numbers, we're building number sense by understanding that each digit's value depends on its position.
