# W1 Day 2: Multi-Digit Multiplication Strategies - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Use the break-apart method:**
41 √ó 6 = (40 + 1) √ó 6 = **240** + **6** = **246**

**Step-by-step solution:**
- Break 41 into 40 + 1
- Multiply: (40 √ó 6) + (1 √ó 6)
- Calculate: 240 + 6 = 246

**Teaching Tip:** Emphasize that breaking apart numbers uses the distributive property. Students should see that (40 + 1) √ó 6 = (40 √ó 6) + (1 √ó 6). This connects to algebra concepts they'll learn later.

**2. Try this strategy:**
68 √ó 5 = (**60** + **8**) √ó 5 = **300** + **40** = **340**

**Step-by-step solution:**
- Break 68 into 60 + 8
- Multiply: (60 √ó 5) + (8 √ó 5)
- Calculate: 300 + 40 = 340

**Teaching Tip:** When students get comfortable with tens and ones, challenge them to try breaking apart the second factor too: 68 √ó 5 could become (70 - 2) √ó 5 = 350 - 10 = 340.

**3. Challenge yourself:**
27 √ó 7 = **189**

**Step-by-step solution using place value:**
- Method 1: (20 + 7) √ó 7 = (20 √ó 7) + (7 √ó 7) = 140 + 49 = 189
- Method 2: (30 - 3) √ó 7 = (30 √ó 7) - (3 √ó 7) = 210 - 21 = 189

**Teaching Tip:** Show students both methods! Some find "friendly numbers" (like 30) easier to work with, even when it involves subtraction.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Why does breaking apart 98 √ó 6 as (100 - 2) √ó 6 = 600 - 12 = 588 work?

**Sample Answer:** This works because of the distributive property. When we multiply (100 - 2) √ó 6, we're really doing (100 √ó 6) - (2 √ó 6). Since 100 √ó 6 = 600 and 2 √ó 6 = 12, we get 600 - 12 = 588. Using "friendly numbers" like 100 makes mental math easier.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Encourage Multiple Strategies:** If your child prefers (90 + 8) √ó 6 over (100 - 2) √ó 6, that's perfectly fine! Different approaches work for different people.
- **Connect to Real Life:** "If movie tickets cost $12 each, how much would 23 tickets cost?" Break 23 into 20 + 3, then calculate (20 √ó $12) + (3 √ó $12).
- **Visual Models:** Draw arrays or area models. For 23 √ó 4, draw a rectangle and split it into a 20 √ó 4 section and a 3 √ó 4 section.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Keeping track of place values when breaking apart
**Try this:** Use different colors for tens and ones. Write 41 √ó 6 as (40 + 1) √ó 6 with 40 in blue and 1 in red.

**If students struggle with:** Adding the partial products
**Try this:** Line up the partial products vertically:
```
  240  (40 √ó 6)
+   6  (1 √ó 6)
-----
  246
```

**If students struggle with:** Choosing which number to break apart
**Try this:** Generally break apart the larger number, but sometimes breaking the smaller number works well too. Try 25 √ó 16 as 25 √ó (10 + 6) = 250 + 150 = 400.
