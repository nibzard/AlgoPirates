# 🐍 Python Basics & Print Statements

## What is Python?
Python is a computer language that helps us tell computers what to do. It's like giving instructions to a very smart robot! Python can do math, draw pictures, and solve problems just like we do on paper.

## Getting Started with Google Colab
📱 **Your Digital Notebook**: Google Colab is like a digital notebook where we write Python instructions.

**How to run Python code:**
1. Click on a **code cell** (the gray box)
2. Press the **▶️ Play button** or press **Shift + Enter**
3. Watch the magic happen below!

## The `print()` Function
The most important Python command is `print()`. It tells the computer to show us something!

### 🔍 Worked Example: Basic Printing

```python
print("Hello, mathematicians!")
print("Welcome to Python!")
```

**What happens:** The computer shows these messages on the screen.

### 📝 Guided Practice

**Q1:** Complete this code to print your name:
```python
print("My name is ____")
```

**Q2:** Write code to print two lines:
```python
print("I love math!")
print("____")  # Add your own message
```

**Q3:** Create a greeting for your family:
```python
# Write three print statements here
```

## Numbers in Python
Python is great at math! It can work with numbers just like we do.

### 🔍 Worked Example: Python Calculator

```python
print(5 + 3)    # Addition
print(10 - 4)   # Subtraction  
print(6 * 7)    # Multiplication
print(20 / 4)   # Division
```

**What happens:** Python shows the answers: 8, 6, 42, 5.0

### 📝 More Practice

**Try this:**
```python
print("2 + 3 =", 2 + 3)
print("10 × 4 =", 10 * 4)
```

## 🚀 Your Mission This Week
When you see today's Colab notebook:
1. Look for `print()` statements
2. Run the code and watch what appears
3. Try changing numbers or messages
4. **Remember:** Python follows the same math rules you know!
