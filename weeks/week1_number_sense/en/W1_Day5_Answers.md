# W1 Day 5: Missing Factor Number Puzzles - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Use division to solve:**
3 √ó ? = 27
? = 27 √∑ **3** = **9**

**Step-by-step solution:**
- We need to find what number times 3 equals 27
- Since multiplication and division are inverse operations: 3 √ó ? = 27 means ? = 27 √∑ 3
- 27 √∑ 3 = 9
- Check: 3 √ó 9 = 27 ‚úì

**Teaching Tip:** Help students see the relationship triangle: if A √ó B = C, then C √∑ A = B and C √∑ B = A. Any time we know two parts of this relationship, we can find the third.

**2. Missing first factor:**
? √ó 6 = 42
? = **42** √∑ **6** = **7**

**Step-by-step solution:**
- We need to find what number times 6 equals 42
- Use division: ? = 42 √∑ 6
- 42 √∑ 6 = 7
- Check: 7 √ó 6 = 42 ‚úì

**Teaching Tip:** Point out that it doesn't matter which factor is missing - we can always use division to find it. The key is identifying which numbers we know and which one we're looking for.

**3. Create your own:**
Write a missing factor puzzle where the answer is 8:

**Sample answers (any of these work):**
- **2** √ó ? = **16** (? = 8)
- **8** √ó ? = **64** (? = 8) 
- **4** √ó ? = **32** (? = 8)
- **5** √ó ? = **40** (? = 8)

**Teaching Tip:** Encourage creativity! Students could use any multiplication fact they know where 8 is a factor. This reinforces their multiplication tables while showing the flexibility of mathematical thinking.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Explain the connection between these two problems: "84 √∑ 12 = ?" and "? √ó 12 = 84"

**Sample Answer:** These problems are asking the exact same question in two different ways! Both are asking "What number times 12 equals 84?" Division is just the flip side of multiplication. When we solve 84 √∑ 12, we're finding the missing factor in ? √ó 12 = 84. They're both fact family problems that have the same answer: 7. This is why we can check division by multiplying, and solve missing factor problems by dividing.

**Alternative explanation:** They're both asking "How many groups of 12 make 84?" or "What do I multiply by 12 to get 84?" The answer (7) works for both because multiplication and division are inverse operations.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Fact Family Practice:** Create fact family triangles. Put 84 at the top, 12 and 7 at the bottom corners. Practice: 12 √ó 7 = 84, 7 √ó 12 = 84, 84 √∑ 12 = 7, 84 √∑ 7 = 12.
- **Real-World Missing Factors:** "If 6 friends equally split the cost of a $48 pizza, how much does each person pay?" This is 6 √ó ? = 48.
- **Make It a Game:** Take turns creating missing factor puzzles for each other. Start with easier facts and work up to more challenging ones.
- **Use Known Facts:** If your child knows 8 √ó 7 = 56, they automatically know three more facts: 7 √ó 8 = 56, 56 √∑ 8 = 7, and 56 √∑ 7 = 8.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Knowing which operation to use
**Try this:** Teach the question "What times what equals what?" For 4 √ó ? = 28, ask "4 times what equals 28?" The answer comes from 28 √∑ 4.

**If students struggle with:** Division facts for finding missing factors
**Try this:** Use arrays or area models. For ? √ó 6 = 42, draw a rectangle with area 42 and width 6. The length must be 7.

**If students struggle with:** Checking their answers
**Try this:** Always substitute back into the original equation. If they think 5 √ó ? = 35 has answer 7, check: 5 √ó 7 = 35? Yes!

**If students struggle with:** Creating their own problems
**Try this:** Start with a multiplication fact they know well (like 6 √ó 9 = 54) and help them write it three different ways:
- 6 √ó ? = 54
- ? √ó 9 = 54  
- 54 √∑ 6 = ?

**If students struggle with:** Large numbers
**Try this:** Break down the division. For ? √ó 12 = 84, think: "I know 12 √ó 5 = 60, and 12 √ó 2 = 24, so 12 √ó 7 = 84."
