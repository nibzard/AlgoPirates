# W1 Day 4: Rounding and Estimation Games - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Round to the nearest ten:**
3,149 ≈ **3,150**
(Look at the ones digit: **9**)

**Step-by-step solution:**
- We're rounding to the nearest ten, so look at the tens place (4)
- Check the ones digit to the right: 9
- Since 9 ≥ 5, round up
- 3,149 becomes 3,150

**Teaching Tip:** Help students identify the "rounding digit" (the place they're rounding to) and the "helper digit" (the one to its right). The helper digit tells us which direction to go.

**2. Round to the nearest hundred:**
8,760 ≈ **8,800**

**Step-by-step solution:**
- We're rounding to the nearest hundred, so look at the hundreds place (7)
- Check the tens digit to the right: 6
- Since 6 ≥ 5, round up
- 8,760 becomes 8,800

**Teaching Tip:** When rounding up changes multiple digits (like 760 → 800), show students that all digits to the right of the rounding place become zero.

**3. Round to the nearest thousand:**
65,499 ≈ **65,000**

**Step-by-step solution:**
- We're rounding to the nearest thousand, so look at the thousands place (5)
- Check the hundreds digit to the right: 4
- Since 4 < 5, round down (keep the same)
- 65,499 becomes 65,000

**Teaching Tip:** Emphasize that rounding down means keeping the rounding digit the same and making all digits to the right become zeros.

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Why is rounding 248,921 to the nearest thousand useful when solving real-world problems?

**Sample Answer:** Rounding 248,921 to 249,000 makes numbers easier to work with mentally and gives us a "close enough" answer for many real-world situations. For example, if this represents the population of a city, knowing it's "about 249,000 people" is often more useful than the exact number for planning purposes, budgeting, or making comparisons. It also helps us check if our exact calculations are reasonable.

## 🏠 Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Real-World Applications:** Use rounding everywhere! "The grocery bill was $47.83 - that's about $48." "It takes 23 minutes to get to school - roughly 25 minutes."
- **Estimation Before Calculation:** Before solving 298 + 156, estimate: "about 300 + 150 = 450." Then check if the exact answer (454) makes sense.
- **Money Connections:** Rounding to the nearest dollar is very practical. $3.79 + $6.21 ≈ $4 + $6 = $10.
- **News and Data:** When reading about populations, distances, or large numbers in news, discuss what the rounded versions might be.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Identifying which digit to look at
**Try this:** Create a two-column chart: "Rounding to..." | "Look at the digit in..."
- Nearest ten → ones place
- Nearest hundred → tens place  
- Nearest thousand → hundreds place

**If students struggle with:** The 5-rule (5 or more rounds up)
**Try this:** Use a number line visual. Show that 5 is exactly halfway, so we have a rule to always go up when we're exactly in the middle.

**If students struggle with:** What happens when rounding up
**Try this:** Practice with examples where rounding causes "carrying":
- 199 → 200 (nearest ten)
- 1,950 → 2,000 (nearest hundred)
Show how the digits cascade upward.

**If students struggle with:** Large numbers
**Try this:** Use place value charts to keep track of positions. Write the number in a chart and circle the rounding place, then box the helper digit:

| Ten Thousands | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |
|---------------|-----------|----------|------|------|
| 2             | 4         | 8        | 9    | 2    |

For nearest thousand: 4 is circled, 8 is boxed → round up to 25,000
