# Week 8 Day 1 – Strategy

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Work backwards to find the starting number.
I think of a number, double it, add 5, and get 17.
17 - 5 = 12
12 / 2 = 6

## Guided Practice
1. ? × 2 + 3 = 11
2. ? × 3 - 4 = 8
3. ? ÷ 2 + 6 = 17
4. ? × 5 - 7 = 18
5. ? ÷ 3 + 2 = 9

## Challenge
6. Explain how working backwards can solve tricky problems.

## Stretch / Colab
Open `nim_bot.py` and see how the bot plans its moves.

## Exit Ticket
Write your own small "work backwards" puzzle.
