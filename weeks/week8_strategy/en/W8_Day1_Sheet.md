# W8 Day 1: Working Backwards Strategy

‚è± **Duration:** 15 minutes

## üîç Worked Example

**Using the "Work Backwards" Problem-Solving Strategy**

**Problem:** I think of a number, double it, add 5, and get 17. What was my starting number?

**Step 1:** Understand what happened to the number
- Started with unknown number: ?
- Doubled it: ? √ó 2
- Added 5: (? √ó 2) + 5
- Final result: 17

**Step 2:** Work backwards - undo each step
- We ended with 17
- The last operation was "+ 5", so undo it: 17 - 5 = 12
- Before that was "√ó 2", so undo it: 12 √∑ 2 = 6

**Step 3:** Check our answer
- Start with 6
- Double it: 6 √ó 2 = 12
- Add 5: 12 + 5 = 17 ‚úì

**Answer:** The starting number was 6.

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Working backwards helps us solve problems by undoing operations in reverse order until we reach the starting point.

## üìù Guided Practice

**Solve these "work backwards" problems:**

**1.** ? √ó 2 + 3 = 11

**2.** ? √ó 3 - 4 = 8

**3.** ? √∑ 2 + 6 = 17

**4.** ? √ó 5 - 7 = 18

**5.** ? √∑ 3 + 2 = 9

## üöÄ Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Create your own "work backwards" word problem! Think of a real-life situation where someone might need to work backwards to solve a problem (like figuring out what time to leave home to arrive somewhere on time).

**Real-world connection:** Working backwards helps solve many everyday problems: What time should I wake up to get to school on time? How much money did I start with before shopping? What temperature should I set the oven to achieve the right cooking result?

**Colab Connection:** Open `nim_bot.py` and observe how the computer plans its strategy by thinking ahead and working backwards from winning positions.

**Paper Fallback:** Create a "work backwards" story problem about planning a party or trip, showing all the steps someone would need to work through in reverse.
