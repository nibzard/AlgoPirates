## üîç Worked Example

**Solving Logic Puzzles with Systematic Reasoning**

**Problem:** Anna, Ben, and Cara each own a different pet: dog, cat, or fish.
- Clue 1: Anna doesn't own the cat
- Clue 2: Ben doesn't own the dog

**Step 1:** Set up what we know
- Three people: Anna, Ben, Cara
- Three pets: dog, cat, fish
- Each person owns exactly one pet

**Step 2:** Use the clues systematically
- From Clue 1: Anna owns either dog or fish (not cat)
- From Clue 2: Ben owns either cat or fish (not dog)

**Step 3:** Apply logical deduction
- If Anna doesn't own the cat, and Ben doesn't own the dog...
- Then Cara must own the dog (only option left for the dog)
- Since Cara owns the dog, Ben must own either cat or fish
- Since Anna can't own the cat, Anna must own the fish
- This leaves Ben with the cat

**Answer:** Cara owns the dog, Ben owns the cat, Anna owns the fish.

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Logical reasoning helps us solve problems by systematically eliminating possibilities until we find the unique solution.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Design your own three-person, three-item logic puzzle! Create a scenario (like favorite foods, favorite colors, or hobbies) and write 2-3 clues that lead to exactly one solution. Test it on a family member!

**Real-world connection:** Logic and deductive reasoning help solve mysteries, debug computer programs, make medical diagnoses, and even figure out the best route through traffic!

**Colab Connection:** Play `nim_bot.py` and observe how the computer uses logical strategy to plan winning moves.

**Paper Fallback:** Create a logic grid with rows for people and columns for items. Use X's and O's to track what you know and what you've eliminated.
