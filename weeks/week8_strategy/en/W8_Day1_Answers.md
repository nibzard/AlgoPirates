# W8 Day 1: Working Backwards Strategy - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Answers

**1.** ? √ó 2 + 3 = 11
   - Work backwards: 11 - 3 = 8, then 8 √∑ 2 = **4**
   - Check: 4 √ó 2 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ‚úì

**2.** ? √ó 3 - 4 = 8
   - Work backwards: 8 + 4 = 12, then 12 √∑ 3 = **4**
   - Check: 4 √ó 3 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 ‚úì

**3.** ? √∑ 2 + 6 = 17
   - Work backwards: 17 - 6 = 11, then 11 √ó 2 = **22**
   - Check: 22 √∑ 2 + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17 ‚úì

**4.** ? √ó 5 - 7 = 18
   - Work backwards: 18 + 7 = 25, then 25 √∑ 5 = **5**
   - Check: 5 √ó 5 - 7 = 25 - 7 = 18 ‚úì

**5.** ? √∑ 3 + 2 = 9
   - Work backwards: 9 - 2 = 7, then 7 √ó 3 = **21**
   - Check: 21 √∑ 3 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9 ‚úì

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample word problem:**
"Maya wants to arrive at the movie theater by 7:00 PM. The movie theater is 20 minutes away by car, and she needs 15 minutes to get ready. What time should she start getting ready?"

**Working backwards:**
- Target time: 7:00 PM
- Subtract travel time: 7:00 - 20 minutes = 6:40 PM (leave house)
- Subtract getting ready time: 6:40 - 15 minutes = 6:25 PM (start getting ready)

## üéØ Exit Ticket Sample Answers

**Student-created puzzles:**
- "I think of a number, add 8, multiply by 2, and get 24. What's my number?" (Answer: 4)
- "Start with a number, subtract 3, divide by 4, and get 2. What was the starting number?" (Answer: 11)

**Why working backwards is useful:**
- "It helps when you know the end result but need to find the beginning"
- "You can check your answer by working forwards again"
- "It breaks complicated problems into simpler steps"
- "It's like solving a mystery by following clues in reverse"

## üí° Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Working backwards undoes operations in reverse order
- Each operation has an "opposite" that undoes it
- Always check the answer by working forwards
- This strategy works for both math and real-life problems

**Operation opposites:**
- **Addition ‚Üî Subtraction:** +5 undone by -5
- **Multiplication ‚Üî Division:** √ó3 undone by √∑3
- **Subtraction ‚Üî Addition:** -7 undone by +7
- **Division ‚Üî Multiplication:** √∑4 undone by √ó4

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simpler, one-step problems
- Use concrete examples (money, time, age problems)
- Draw diagrams showing the forward and backward paths
- Practice identifying which operation undoes another

**Real-world applications:**
- **Time management:** Working backwards from deadlines
- **Cooking:** Calculating when to start each dish
- **Budgeting:** Figuring out starting money amount
- **Travel planning:** Determining departure times

**Problem-solving steps:**
1. **Understand:** What operations were done?
2. **Reverse:** Work backwards, undoing each step
3. **Check:** Work forwards to verify the answer
4. **Reflect:** Does the answer make sense?

**Common mistakes:**
- **Forgetting the order:** Operations must be undone in reverse order
- **Wrong opposites:** Using wrong inverse operation
- **Skipping the check:** Not verifying the answer

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child gets confused about operation order
  - **Help:** Write out all steps first, then number them backwards
- **Mistake:** Child uses wrong inverse operations
  - **Help:** Practice operation pairs with simple examples
- **Mistake:** Child doesn't check their work
  - **Help:** Make checking a required final step, show how it catches errors
