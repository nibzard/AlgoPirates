# W8 Day 1: Working Backwards Strategy - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1.** ? √ó 2 + 3 = 11
   - Work backwards: 11 - 3 = 8, then 8 √∑ 2 = **4**
   - Check: 4 √ó 2 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ‚úì
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Emphasize that working backwards means doing the opposite operations in reverse order. Show students that addition becomes subtraction, and multiplication becomes division. This builds understanding of inverse operations, which is crucial for algebraic thinking.

**2.** ? √ó 3 - 4 = 8
   - Work backwards: 8 + 4 = 12, then 12 √∑ 3 = **4**
   - Check: 4 √ó 3 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 ‚úì
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Help students understand that subtraction undoes addition (8 + 4 = 12), and division undoes multiplication (12 √∑ 3 = 4). Create visual diagrams showing the forward and backward paths to reinforce the concept of inverse operations.

**3.** ? √∑ 2 + 6 = 17
   - Work backwards: 17 - 6 = 11, then 11 √ó 2 = **22**
   - Check: 22 √∑ 2 + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17 ‚úì
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Point out that division appears first in the forward direction but gets undone last when working backwards. This helps students understand order of operations and that we must reverse not just the operations but also their sequence.

**4.** ? √ó 5 - 7 = 18
   - Work backwards: 18 + 7 = 25, then 25 √∑ 5 = **5**
   - Check: 5 √ó 5 - 7 = 25 - 7 = 18 ‚úì
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Encourage students to always perform the verification step by working forward. This checking process builds confidence and helps catch computational errors. It also reinforces the relationship between forward and backward thinking.

**5.** ? √∑ 3 + 2 = 9
   - Work backwards: 9 - 2 = 7, then 7 √ó 3 = **21**
   - Check: 21 √∑ 3 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9 ‚úì
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Use this problem to discuss how multiplication can help verify division problems. When students multiply 7 √ó 3 to get 21, they're confirming that 21 √∑ 3 = 7. This strengthens understanding of fact families and inverse relationships.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample word problem:**
"Maya wants to arrive at the movie theater by 7:00 PM. The movie theater is 20 minutes away by car, and she needs 15 minutes to get ready. What time should she start getting ready?"

**Working backwards:**
- Target time: 7:00 PM
- Subtract travel time: 7:00 - 20 minutes = 6:40 PM (leave house)
- Subtract getting ready time: 6:40 - 15 minutes = 6:25 PM (start getting ready)

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Student-created puzzles:**
- "I think of a number, add 8, multiply by 2, and get 24. What's my number?" (Answer: 4)
- "Start with a number, subtract 3, divide by 4, and get 2. What was the starting number?" (Answer: 11)

**Why working backwards is useful:**
- "It helps when you know the end result but need to find the beginning"
- "You can check your answer by working forwards again"
- "It breaks complicated problems into simpler steps"
- "It's like solving a mystery by following clues in reverse"

**Sample Student Response:** "Today I learned that working backwards is like being a detective. When I know the final answer but need to find what I started with, I can undo each step in reverse order. The coolest part is checking my work by going forward again - it's like solving the same puzzle twice!"

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Working backwards undoes operations in reverse order
- Each operation has an "opposite" that undoes it
- Always check the answer by working forwards
- This strategy works for both math and real-life problems

**Operation opposites:**
- **Addition ‚Üî Subtraction:** +5 undone by -5
- **Multiplication ‚Üî Division:** √ó3 undone by √∑3
- **Subtraction ‚Üî Addition:** -7 undone by +7
- **Division ‚Üî Multiplication:** √∑4 undone by √ó4

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simpler, one-step problems
- Use concrete examples (money, time, age problems)
- Draw diagrams showing the forward and backward paths
- Practice identifying which operation undoes another

**Real-world applications:**
- **Time management:** Working backwards from deadlines
- **Cooking:** Calculating when to start each dish
- **Budgeting:** Figuring out starting money amount
- **Travel planning:** Determining departure times

**Problem-solving steps:**
1. **Understand:** What operations were done?
2. **Reverse:** Work backwards, undoing each step
3. **Check:** Work forwards to verify the answer
4. **Reflect:** Does the answer make sense?

**Common mistakes:**
- **Forgetting the order:** Operations must be undone in reverse order
- **Wrong opposites:** Using wrong inverse operation
- **Skipping the check:** Not verifying the answer

‚Ä¢ **Common mistakes to watch for:** Students often confuse the order of operations when working backwards, or forget which operation undoes which (like using addition instead of subtraction)
‚Ä¢ **Visual support strategies:** Draw arrows showing the forward path, then trace backwards with different colored arrows to help students visualize the reverse process
‚Ä¢ **Real-world connections:** Use scheduling examples ("If the movie starts at 7 PM and we need 30 minutes to get there...") to make working backwards feel practical and relevant

## üîß Troubleshooting

‚Ä¢ **If students struggle with operation order:** Try this - Write out all steps first, then number them backwards. Have students physically cross out each step as they undo it to maintain sequence awareness.

‚Ä¢ **If students use wrong inverse operations:** Try this - Create an "operation opposites" reference chart and practice with simple examples like "5 + 3 = 8, so 8 - 3 = 5" before attempting complex problems.

‚Ä¢ **If students skip the verification step:** Try this - Make checking a required final step and show how it catches errors. Create a rule: "No problem is complete until you've proven your answer works by going forward again."
