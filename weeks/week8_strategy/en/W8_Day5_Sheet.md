## üîç Worked Example

**Designing Engaging Math Riddles**

**Mission:** Create a short mathematical riddle that's challenging but solvable.

**Step 1:** Choose a solution first
- Let's say our answer will be 7

**Step 2:** Work backwards to create operations
- Start with 7
- Double it: 7 √ó 2 = 14
- Subtract 4: 14 - 4 = 10

**Step 3:** Write the riddle
- "I think of a number, double it, subtract 4, and get 10. What is my number?"

**Step 4:** Test the riddle
- Check: 7 √ó 2 - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10 ‚úì
- Verify it has exactly one solution

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Creating puzzles requires strategic thinking about difficulty level, clarity, and ensuring there's a unique, logical solution.
