# W8 Day 2: Spatial Reasoning with Pentominoes

‚è± **Duration:** 15 minutes

## üîç Worked Example

**Solving Spatial Puzzles with Pentominoes**

**Problem:** Fit an L-shaped pentomino and a T-shaped pentomino into a 5√ó5 grid, leaving exactly one square empty.

**Step 1:** Understand pentominoes
- Each pentomino covers exactly 5 squares
- L-shape: looks like a corner or boot
- T-shape: looks like the letter T

**Step 2:** Calculate the space
- 5√ó5 grid = 25 total squares
- L-pentomino = 5 squares
- T-pentomino = 5 squares
- Used space: 5 + 5 = 10 squares
- Empty space: 25 - 10 = 15 squares

**Step 3:** Strategy approach
- Try placing the L-pentomino in a corner first
- Then see where the T-pentomino can fit
- Experiment with rotations and flips

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Spatial reasoning helps us visualize how shapes fit together and develop systematic approaches to puzzle-solving.

## üìù Guided Practice

**1. Grid planning:** Draw a 5√ó5 grid and mark one spot where an L-pentomino could fit. Show all 5 squares it would cover.

**2. Size check:** How many squares does each pentomino piece cover?

**3. Rectangle challenge:** Which two different pentomino shapes could work together to form a 5√ó2 rectangle?

**4. Area investigation:** Can you arrange F-shaped and Z-shaped pentominoes to completely cover a 5√ó4 board with no gaps or overlaps?

**5. Tiling pattern:** Name one pentomino shape that could tile (completely fill) a rectangle all by itself.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Become a pentomino puzzle master! Try to find another way to fill a 5√ó5 board using exactly five different pentomino pieces. Draw your solution and explain your strategy.

**Real-world connection:** Spatial reasoning skills help in architecture, engineering, packing and shipping, video game design, and even arranging furniture in a room!

**Colab Connection:** Run `nim_bot.py` and think about how the computer bot uses strategic thinking to plan several moves ahead.

**Paper Fallback:** Create your own pentomino puzzle by drawing a rectangular grid and challenging someone to fill it with specific pieces.
