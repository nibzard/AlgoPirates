# W8 Day 5: Creating Mathematical Puzzles - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Addition riddle:** Sample student creations:
   - "I add 15 to a mystery number and get 23. What's the number?" (Answer: 8)
   - "The sum of my number and 12 equals 19. Find my number." (Answer: 7)
   - "I think of a number, add 6, then add 4 more, and get 18. What's my number?" (Answer: 8)
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Encourage students to work backwards from their chosen answer to create the puzzle. This reverse-engineering process strengthens understanding of inverse operations and helps ensure their puzzles have unique, logical solutions. Praise creative contexts that make problems more engaging.

**2. Subtraction riddle:** Sample student creations:
   - "I subtract 9 from my number and get 5. What's my number?" (Answer: 14)
   - "Take my number, subtract 8, and you get 11. What is it?" (Answer: 19)
   - "My number minus 15 equals 7. Find my number." (Answer: 22)
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Help students understand that subtraction puzzles can be solved by addition (working backwards). This reinforces the relationship between operations and builds algebraic thinking. Encourage variety in language ("subtract," "take away," "minus") to develop mathematical vocabulary.

**3. Mixed operations riddle:** Sample student creations:
   - "I multiply my number by 3, then add 5, and get 20. What's my number?" (Answer: 5)
   - "Double my number, add 7, and you get 15. What's my number?" (Answer: 4)
   - "I multiply by 4, subtract 3, and get 13. Find my number." (Answer: 4)
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Multi-step puzzles require students to understand order of operations and inverse operations. Show how to work backwards step by step: undo the last operation first, then the second-to-last, and so on. This builds systematic thinking and prepares students for algebraic equation solving.

**4. Puzzle exchange:** Results will vary
   - Encourage students to give feedback on clarity and difficulty
   - Look for puzzles that are challenging but solvable
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Use peer feedback to develop students' critical thinking and communication skills. Teach them to give constructive feedback: "This puzzle was clear because..." or "I got confused when...". This peer review process mirrors real mathematical collaboration and publication.

**5. Difficulty strategies:** Ways to make puzzles harder:
   - Use larger numbers
   - Add more operations
   - Include fractions or decimals
   - Create multi-step problems
   - Add context or story elements
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Help students understand that difficulty should be appropriate for the intended audience. Discuss how good puzzle creators consider their solver's skill level and gradually increase challenge. This develops empathy and understanding of differentiated learning.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample three-operation puzzle:**
"Maya's Adventure: Maya starts with a secret number. She triples it, then subtracts 8, then divides by 2, and ends up with 10. What was Maya's secret number?"

**Solution process:**
- Work backwards: 10 √ó 2 = 20, then 20 + 8 = 28, then 28 √∑ 3 = 9.33...
- Wait, that doesn't work with whole numbers!
- Let's try: Final result is 10 ‚Üí before dividing by 2 was 20 ‚Üí before subtracting 8 was 28 ‚Üí original number was 28 √∑ 3 = 9.33...
- Better puzzle: "She triples it, subtracts 6, divides by 3, and gets 8." (Answer: 10)

**Connected puzzle series example:**
1. "I add 5 to my number and get 12. What's my number?" (Answer: 7)
2. "I multiply the previous answer by 2 and subtract 3. What do I get?" (Answer: 11)  
3. "I divide the previous result by 11 and add 9. What's my final answer?" (Answer: 10)

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Design strategies students used:**
- "I worked backwards from the answer to create the operations"
- "I tested my puzzle on myself first to make sure it worked"
- "I used a story to make the puzzle more interesting"
- "I made sure there was only one possible answer"

**What makes riddles challenging but fair:**
- "Clear wording so people understand what to do"
- "Not too easy but not impossible to solve"
- "Has exactly one correct answer"
- "Uses math concepts the solver should know"
- "Gives enough information but not too much"

**Sample Student Response:** "Creating math puzzles taught me to think like a teacher! I learned that good puzzles have clear instructions and exactly one answer. The best strategy is working backwards from the solution. It's fun to make problems that challenge my friends but don't frustrate them. Now I understand why some word problems are harder than others!"

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Good puzzles have unique, logical solutions
- Working backwards from the answer helps create balanced problems
- Difficulty should match the solver's skill level
- Clear language prevents confusion

**Elements of effective math puzzles:**
- **Clear problem statement:** No ambiguous wording
- **Appropriate difficulty:** Challenging but achievable
- **Unique solution:** Only one correct answer
- **Testable:** Creator can verify the solution works
- **Engaging context:** Story or scenario that connects to real life

**If your child struggles with puzzle creation:**
- Start with simple one-operation puzzles
- Practice working backwards from known answers
- Use familiar contexts (age, money, time)
- Test puzzles together before sharing with others

**Encouraging creativity:**
- Let them choose their own contexts and stories
- Praise clever or creative approaches
- Help them see that puzzle creation is a form of mathematical art
- Connect to games and activities they enjoy

**Scaffolding puzzle difficulty:**
- **Beginner:** Single operation, small numbers
- **Intermediate:** Two operations, larger numbers
- **Advanced:** Three+ operations, mixed number types
- **Expert:** Multiple steps, real-world contexts

**Benefits of puzzle creation:**
- **Reverse thinking:** Working backwards strengthens problem-solving
- **Empathy:** Understanding what makes problems clear or confusing
- **Communication:** Expressing mathematical ideas clearly
- **Quality control:** Testing and refining their work

**Real-world connections:**
- **Game design:** Creating challenges for video games or board games
- **Education:** Teachers create problems for students
- **Security:** Designing puzzles and codes to protect information
- **Entertainment:** Puzzle books, escape rooms, brain teaser apps

‚Ä¢ **Common mistakes to watch for:** Students often create puzzles with no solution or multiple solutions, make problems too hard or too easy for their intended audience, or use confusing or ambiguous language
‚Ä¢ **Visual support strategies:** Encourage students to draw diagrams or use physical objects to test their puzzles, and provide templates with clear mathematical language patterns for different types of problems
‚Ä¢ **Real-world connections:** Connect to game design, textbook writing, and educational app development to show how puzzle creation is a valuable skill in entertainment and education industries

## üîß Troubleshooting

‚Ä¢ **If students create unsolvable puzzles:** Try this - Teach them to always work through their puzzle step-by-step before sharing it. Create a "puzzle checklist" that includes "Does this have exactly one answer?" and "Can I solve it myself?"

‚Ä¢ **If students make puzzles too hard or easy:** Try this - Have them test puzzles on family members or classmates at their math level first, then adjust difficulty based on feedback before finalizing.

‚Ä¢ **If students use confusing language:** Try this - Read puzzles aloud together and identify any unclear parts. Provide sentence starters like "I think of a number..." or "Starting with my mystery number..." to model clear mathematical communication.
