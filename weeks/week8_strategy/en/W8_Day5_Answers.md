# W8 Day 5: Creating Mathematical Puzzles - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Answers

**1. Addition riddle:** Sample student creations:
   - "I add 15 to a mystery number and get 23. What's the number?" (Answer: 8)
   - "The sum of my number and 12 equals 19. Find my number." (Answer: 7)
   - "I think of a number, add 6, then add 4 more, and get 18. What's my number?" (Answer: 8)

**2. Subtraction riddle:** Sample student creations:
   - "I subtract 9 from my number and get 5. What's my number?" (Answer: 14)
   - "Take my number, subtract 8, and you get 11. What is it?" (Answer: 19)
   - "My number minus 15 equals 7. Find my number." (Answer: 22)

**3. Mixed operations riddle:** Sample student creations:
   - "I multiply my number by 3, then add 5, and get 20. What's my number?" (Answer: 5)
   - "Double my number, add 7, and you get 15. What's my number?" (Answer: 4)
   - "I multiply by 4, subtract 3, and get 13. Find my number." (Answer: 4)

**4. Puzzle exchange:** Results will vary
   - Encourage students to give feedback on clarity and difficulty
   - Look for puzzles that are challenging but solvable

**5. Difficulty strategies:** Ways to make puzzles harder:
   - Use larger numbers
   - Add more operations
   - Include fractions or decimals
   - Create multi-step problems
   - Add context or story elements

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample three-operation puzzle:**
"Maya's Adventure: Maya starts with a secret number. She triples it, then subtracts 8, then divides by 2, and ends up with 10. What was Maya's secret number?"

**Solution process:**
- Work backwards: 10 √ó 2 = 20, then 20 + 8 = 28, then 28 √∑ 3 = 9.33...
- Wait, that doesn't work with whole numbers!
- Let's try: Final result is 10 ‚Üí before dividing by 2 was 20 ‚Üí before subtracting 8 was 28 ‚Üí original number was 28 √∑ 3 = 9.33...
- Better puzzle: "She triples it, subtracts 6, divides by 3, and gets 8." (Answer: 10)

**Connected puzzle series example:**
1. "I add 5 to my number and get 12. What's my number?" (Answer: 7)
2. "I multiply the previous answer by 2 and subtract 3. What do I get?" (Answer: 11)  
3. "I divide the previous result by 11 and add 9. What's my final answer?" (Answer: 10)

## üéØ Exit Ticket Sample Answers

**Design strategies students used:**
- "I worked backwards from the answer to create the operations"
- "I tested my puzzle on myself first to make sure it worked"
- "I used a story to make the puzzle more interesting"
- "I made sure there was only one possible answer"

**What makes riddles challenging but fair:**
- "Clear wording so people understand what to do"
- "Not too easy but not impossible to solve"
- "Has exactly one correct answer"
- "Uses math concepts the solver should know"
- "Gives enough information but not too much"

## üí° Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Good puzzles have unique, logical solutions
- Working backwards from the answer helps create balanced problems
- Difficulty should match the solver's skill level
- Clear language prevents confusion

**Elements of effective math puzzles:**
- **Clear problem statement:** No ambiguous wording
- **Appropriate difficulty:** Challenging but achievable
- **Unique solution:** Only one correct answer
- **Testable:** Creator can verify the solution works
- **Engaging context:** Story or scenario that connects to real life

**If your child struggles with puzzle creation:**
- Start with simple one-operation puzzles
- Practice working backwards from known answers
- Use familiar contexts (age, money, time)
- Test puzzles together before sharing with others

**Encouraging creativity:**
- Let them choose their own contexts and stories
- Praise clever or creative approaches
- Help them see that puzzle creation is a form of mathematical art
- Connect to games and activities they enjoy

**Scaffolding puzzle difficulty:**
- **Beginner:** Single operation, small numbers
- **Intermediate:** Two operations, larger numbers
- **Advanced:** Three+ operations, mixed number types
- **Expert:** Multiple steps, real-world contexts

**Benefits of puzzle creation:**
- **Reverse thinking:** Working backwards strengthens problem-solving
- **Empathy:** Understanding what makes problems clear or confusing
- **Communication:** Expressing mathematical ideas clearly
- **Quality control:** Testing and refining their work

**Real-world connections:**
- **Game design:** Creating challenges for video games or board games
- **Education:** Teachers create problems for students
- **Security:** Designing puzzles and codes to protect information
- **Entertainment:** Puzzle books, escape rooms, brain teaser apps

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child creates puzzles with no solution or multiple solutions
  - **Help:** Always work through the puzzle yourself before finalizing
- **Mistake:** Child makes puzzles too hard or too easy
  - **Help:** Test on someone of similar math level first
- **Mistake:** Child uses confusing language
  - **Help:** Read the puzzle aloud and look for unclear parts
