# W8 Day 4: Game Theory and Nim Strategy - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Answers

**1.** Starting with 10 stones, first move:
   - 10 √∑ 3 = 3 remainder 1
   - Take **1 stone** to leave 9 stones (multiple of 3)
   - Now opponent faces a losing position

**2.** Starting with 11 stones, opening move:
   - 11 √∑ 3 = 3 remainder 2  
   - Take **2 stones** to leave 9 stones (multiple of 3)
   - Again, opponent is in a losing position

**3.** Starting with 13 stones, best first move:
   - 13 √∑ 3 = 4 remainder 1
   - Take **1 stone** to leave 12 stones (multiple of 3)
   - Continue the winning pattern

**4.** Starting with 5 stones, second player advantage:
   - 5 √∑ 3 = 1 remainder 2
   - If first player doesn't know the strategy, **second player should win**
   - Second player can force a multiple of 3 after first player's move

**5.** Game results will vary:
   - If student applies strategy correctly, they should win when starting from non-multiples of 3
   - Strategy only works if applied consistently throughout the game

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Modified Nim with 1, 2, OR 3 stones per turn:**

**New winning pattern:** Always leave opponent with a multiple of 4 stones
- If they take 1, you take 3 (total removed = 4)
- If they take 2, you take 2 (total removed = 4)  
- If they take 3, you take 1 (total removed = 4)
- This keeps you returning to multiples of 4

**General rule:** When players can take 1 to n stones, the winning strategy is to leave multiples of (n+1) stones.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Sample Answers

**Questions students might have:**
- "What happens in Nim if both players know the perfect strategy?"
- "Are there other games with similar mathematical strategies?"
- "How did mathematicians figure out the winning pattern?"
- "Does the strategy change if there are 3 players instead of 2?"

**Surprising insights:**
- "I didn't know math could guarantee winning a game"
- "It's weird that taking fewer stones can be better than taking more"
- "The strategy works even when my opponent knows I'm using it"
- "Some positions are automatically losing no matter how smart you are"

## üí° Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Nim has positions that are "winning" or "losing" regardless of skill
- The goal is to force your opponent into losing positions
- Mathematical analysis can reveal optimal strategies
- Perfect play leads to predictable outcomes

**The strategy explained:**
- **Goal:** Leave opponent with multiple of 3 stones
- **Why it works:** No matter what they take (1 or 2), you can always get back to a multiple of 3
- **Key insight:** Control the remainder when dividing by 3

**Teaching game theory thinking:**
- **Work backwards:** Start from the end (who wins with 1, 2, 3 stones?)
- **Find patterns:** Look for positions that repeat or cycle
- **Think ahead:** Consider what happens after each possible move
- **Test theories:** Play out scenarios to verify strategies

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with very small games (5-7 stones)
- Use physical objects (coins, blocks) to make it concrete
- Practice the "multiple of 3" rule with division
- Play cooperatively first, both trying to understand the pattern

**Variations to explore:**
- **Different rules:** What if you lose by taking the last stone?
- **Multiple piles:** Nim with 2 or 3 separate piles of stones
- **Different limits:** Taking 1-4 stones, or 1-5 stones per turn
- **Team play:** Two teams of players taking turns

**Real-world connections:**
- **Economics:** Bidding strategies in auctions
- **Sports:** Play-calling in football based on opponent's likely response
- **Psychology:** Understanding how people make decisions under pressure
- **Computer science:** Algorithm design and optimization

**Mathematical connections:**
- **Modular arithmetic:** Working with remainders
- **Proof by induction:** Showing strategies work for all cases
- **Combinatorics:** Counting possible game states
- **Recursive thinking:** Breaking problems into smaller versions

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child forgets to check if number is multiple of 3
  - **Help:** Practice division by 3 and identifying remainders
- **Mistake:** Child takes stones randomly without strategy
  - **Help:** Require them to state their goal before each move
- **Mistake:** Child gets discouraged when strategy seems too hard
  - **Help:** Start with collaborative play where you help them see winning moves
