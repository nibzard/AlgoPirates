# W8 Day 3: Logic Puzzles and Deductive Reasoning - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Answers

**1. Sports puzzle:** Tim, Uma, and Vic's sport choices
   - Tim does not pick soccer ‚Üí Tim picks chess or tennis
   - Vic does not pick tennis ‚Üí Vic picks soccer or chess
   - If Tim picks tennis, then Vic must pick soccer (can't pick tennis), leaving Uma with chess
   - If Tim picks chess, then Vic could pick soccer, leaving Uma with tennis
   - **Answer:** Tim picks tennis, Vic picks soccer, Uma picks chess

**2. House visiting puzzle:** Bus route order
   - Blue house is visited last (3rd position)
   - Red house is not visited first ‚Üí Red house is 2nd or 3rd
   - Since blue is 3rd, red must be 2nd
   - This leaves yellow house first
   - **Answer:** Yellow house (1st), Red house (2nd), Blue house (3rd)

**3. Hidden gem puzzle:** Location with one true clue
   - If A is true (gem in box 1), then C is false (gem IS in box 1) - contradiction
   - If B is true (gem in box 2), then A is false and C could be true or false
   - If C is true (gem NOT in box 1), then A is false, and gem could be in box 2 or 3
   - For exactly one clue to be true: If C is true and A is false, then B must be false
   - **Answer:** The gem is in box 3 (only C is true)

**4. Strategy explanation:** Why logic tables help
   - **Organization:** Keep track of multiple clues systematically
   - **Elimination:** Mark what's impossible with X's
   - **Confirmation:** Mark what's certain with O's or checkmarks
   - **Visual clarity:** See patterns and remaining possibilities

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample student-created puzzle:**
"Maya, Noah, and Zoe each like a different ice cream flavor: vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry.
- Maya doesn't like vanilla
- Noah doesn't like chocolate
- Who likes which flavor?"

**Solution:** Maya likes chocolate, Noah likes strawberry, Zoe likes vanilla

**Puzzle creation tips:**
- Start with the solution, then work backwards to create clues
- Make sure clues lead to exactly one answer
- Test the puzzle on someone else to check clarity

## üéØ Exit Ticket Sample Answers

**What makes logic puzzles enjoyable:**
- "They're like solving mysteries with math clues"
- "I like the feeling when everything clicks into place"
- "It's satisfying to use pure reasoning to find answers"
- "They're challenging but fair - the answer is always there"

**Helpful strategies:**
- "I made a table to keep track of what I knew"
- "I looked for what was definitely impossible first"
- "I worked through each clue step by step"
- "When I got stuck, I tried assuming different possibilities"

## üí° Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Logic puzzles use deductive reasoning to eliminate possibilities
- Each clue provides information that narrows down solutions
- Systematic approaches work better than guessing
- The solution should be unique and provable

**Types of logic puzzles:**
- **Grid puzzles:** Match people/items using elimination tables
- **Constraint puzzles:** Find arrangements that satisfy all conditions
- **Truth/lie puzzles:** Determine what's true when some statements are false
- **Sequence puzzles:** Find the correct order of events

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simpler 2√ó2 puzzles (2 people, 2 items)
- Use physical objects to represent puzzle elements
- Draw pictures or diagrams to visualize the problem
- Work through one clue at a time

**Teaching logical thinking:**
- **Process over answers:** Focus on reasoning, not just getting it right
- **Elimination strategy:** "What can't be true?" is often easier than "What must be true?"
- **Check your work:** Always verify the solution satisfies all clues
- **Multiple approaches:** Some puzzles can be solved different ways

**Making logic grids:**
- Draw rows for one category, columns for another
- Use X for "definitely not," O for "definitely yes"
- Remember: each row and column has exactly one O
- Fill in forced conclusions after each new clue

**Real-world applications:**
- **Problem solving:** Breaking complex problems into logical steps
- **Computer programming:** If-then logic and debugging
- **Scientific method:** Testing hypotheses and drawing conclusions
- **Detective work:** Using evidence to solve mysteries

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child guesses instead of using logic
  - **Help:** Require them to explain their reasoning for each step
- **Mistake:** Child gets confused with multiple clues
  - **Help:** Process one clue at a time, update the grid after each
- **Mistake:** Child gives up when stuck
  - **Help:** Encourage trying "what if" scenarios to test possibilities
