# W8 Day 3: Logic Puzzles and Deductive Reasoning - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Sports puzzle:** Tim, Uma, and Vic's sport choices
   - Tim does not pick soccer ‚Üí Tim picks chess or tennis
   - Vic does not pick tennis ‚Üí Vic picks soccer or chess
   - If Tim picks tennis, then Vic must pick soccer (can't pick tennis), leaving Uma with chess
   - If Tim picks chess, then Vic could pick soccer, leaving Uma with tennis
   - **Answer:** Tim picks tennis, Vic picks soccer, Uma picks chess
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Teach students to create logic grids with names on one axis and choices on the other. Use X for "impossible" and O for "confirmed" to systematically eliminate possibilities. This visual approach makes abstract logical reasoning more concrete and manageable.

**2. House visiting puzzle:** Bus route order
   - Blue house is visited last (3rd position)
   - Red house is not visited first ‚Üí Red house is 2nd or 3rd
   - Since blue is 3rd, red must be 2nd
   - This leaves yellow house first
   - **Answer:** Yellow house (1st), Red house (2nd), Blue house (3rd)
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Show students how to use the process of elimination: start with what you know for certain, then work through the logical consequences. This sequential thinking pattern is fundamental to mathematical reasoning and proof construction.

**3. Hidden gem puzzle:** Location with one true clue
   - If A is true (gem in box 1), then C is false (gem IS in box 1) - contradiction
   - If B is true (gem in box 2), then A is false and C could be true or false
   - If C is true (gem NOT in box 1), then A is false, and gem could be in box 2 or 3
   - For exactly one clue to be true: If C is true and A is false, then B must be false
   - **Answer:** The gem is in box 3 (only C is true)
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Introduce the concept of "proof by contradiction" - assume something is true and see if it leads to an impossible situation. This advanced logical technique helps students develop critical thinking skills and understand how mathematicians verify solutions.

**4. Strategy explanation:** Why logic tables help
   - **Organization:** Keep track of multiple clues systematically
   - **Elimination:** Mark what's impossible with X's
   - **Confirmation:** Mark what's certain with O's or checkmarks
   - **Visual clarity:** See patterns and remaining possibilities
   
   **Teaching Tip:** Emphasize that logic tables are tools for organizing thinking, not just getting answers. Have students explain their reasoning at each step to develop mathematical communication skills. This metacognitive approach strengthens problem-solving abilities across all subjects.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample student-created puzzle:**
"Maya, Noah, and Zoe each like a different ice cream flavor: vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry.
- Maya doesn't like vanilla
- Noah doesn't like chocolate
- Who likes which flavor?"

**Solution:** Maya likes chocolate, Noah likes strawberry, Zoe likes vanilla

**Puzzle creation tips:**
- Start with the solution, then work backwards to create clues
- Make sure clues lead to exactly one answer
- Test the puzzle on someone else to check clarity

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**What makes logic puzzles enjoyable:**
- "They're like solving mysteries with math clues"
- "I like the feeling when everything clicks into place"
- "It's satisfying to use pure reasoning to find answers"
- "They're challenging but fair - the answer is always there"

**Helpful strategies:**
- "I made a table to keep track of what I knew"
- "I looked for what was definitely impossible first"
- "I worked through each clue step by step"
- "When I got stuck, I tried assuming different possibilities"

**Sample Student Response:** "Logic puzzles are like being a detective with math tools! I learned that making tables helps me see what's possible and impossible. The best part is when I eliminate enough options that the answer becomes obvious. It teaches me to think step by step and not give up when things seem confusing."

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Logic puzzles use deductive reasoning to eliminate possibilities
- Each clue provides information that narrows down solutions
- Systematic approaches work better than guessing
- The solution should be unique and provable

**Types of logic puzzles:**
- **Grid puzzles:** Match people/items using elimination tables
- **Constraint puzzles:** Find arrangements that satisfy all conditions
- **Truth/lie puzzles:** Determine what's true when some statements are false
- **Sequence puzzles:** Find the correct order of events

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simpler 2√ó2 puzzles (2 people, 2 items)
- Use physical objects to represent puzzle elements
- Draw pictures or diagrams to visualize the problem
- Work through one clue at a time

**Teaching logical thinking:**
- **Process over answers:** Focus on reasoning, not just getting it right
- **Elimination strategy:** "What can't be true?" is often easier than "What must be true?"
- **Check your work:** Always verify the solution satisfies all clues
- **Multiple approaches:** Some puzzles can be solved different ways

**Making logic grids:**
- Draw rows for one category, columns for another
- Use X for "definitely not," O for "definitely yes"
- Remember: each row and column has exactly one O
- Fill in forced conclusions after each new clue

**Real-world applications:**
- **Problem solving:** Breaking complex problems into logical steps
- **Computer programming:** If-then logic and debugging
- **Scientific method:** Testing hypotheses and drawing conclusions
- **Detective work:** Using evidence to solve mysteries

‚Ä¢ **Common mistakes to watch for:** Students often guess randomly instead of using systematic logic, get overwhelmed by multiple clues, or give up too quickly when they feel stuck
‚Ä¢ **Visual support strategies:** Use physical objects or colored markers to represent different possibilities, and create simple logic grids on paper to make abstract reasoning more concrete
‚Ä¢ **Real-world connections:** Connect to detective work, scientific hypothesis testing, and computer programming logic to show how deductive reasoning applies in many careers and situations

## üîß Troubleshooting

‚Ä¢ **If students guess instead of using logic:** Try this - Require them to explain their reasoning for each step before writing anything down. Ask "How do you know that?" to encourage evidence-based thinking.

‚Ä¢ **If students get confused with multiple clues:** Try this - Process one clue at a time, update the grid after each, and use different colors to track information from different clues. Build complexity gradually.

‚Ä¢ **If students give up when stuck:** Try this - Encourage "what if" scenarios where they assume one possibility is true and trace through the logical consequences to see if it works or creates contradictions.
