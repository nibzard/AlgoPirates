# W8 Day 2: Spatial Reasoning with Pentominoes - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Answers

**1. Grid planning:** L-pentomino placement
   - Sample placement: Top-left corner position
   - The L could occupy squares (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1) in a grid
   - Many other valid placements exist - accept any correct 5-square L arrangement

**2. Size check:** Each pentomino covers exactly **5 squares**
   - This is the defining characteristic of pentominoes
   - "Pent" means five, like pentagon

**3. Rectangle challenge:** Pairs that form 5√ó2 rectangle (10 squares total)
   - **L and P pentominoes** work well together
   - **I and T pentominoes** can also combine
   - **F and any 5-square piece** with compatible shape
   - Accept any valid combination that uses exactly 10 squares

**4. Area investigation:** F and Z pentominoes on 5√ó4 board
   - 5√ó4 board = 20 squares total
   - F-pentomino = 5 squares, Z-pentomino = 5 squares
   - Total coverage = 10 squares
   - **Not possible** to cover entire board - leaves 10 squares uncovered
   - Need 4 pentominoes total to fill a 5√ó4 board

**5. Tiling pattern:** **I-pentomino** tiles rectangles easily
   - The straight line shape can create 5√ón or n√ó5 rectangles
   - Other pieces can tile, but I is the most straightforward

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample 5√ó5 solution using five pentominoes:**
- Use pieces: I, L, T, P, Y (or other valid combinations)
- Strategy tips:
  - Start with corner pieces (L, P)
  - Place straight pieces (I) along edges
  - Fill remaining space with flexible pieces (T, Y, F)
  - Try multiple orientations and rotations

**Problem-solving strategies:**
- **Corner-first approach:** Place angular pieces in corners
- **Edge placement:** Use straight sections along borders  
- **Trial and error:** Systematically try different orientations
- **Work backwards:** Start with harder-to-place pieces

## üéØ Exit Ticket Sample Answers

**Questions students might have:**
- "How many different pentomino shapes exist in total?"
- "Can you make 3D pentominoes with cubes?"
- "Are there computer games that use pentominoes?"
- "What's the biggest rectangle you can fill with all pentomino pieces?"

**Helpful strategies:**
- "I started by placing pieces in the corners first"
- "Rotating pieces helped me find new possibilities"
- "I looked for straight edges to place along the border"
- "Drawing the grid helped me visualize the solution"

## üí° Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Pentominoes are shapes made of exactly 5 connected squares
- There are 12 different pentomino shapes (F, I, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Spatial reasoning involves visualizing rotations and reflections
- Systematic approaches work better than random guessing

**Pentomino benefits:**
- **Spatial awareness:** Understanding how shapes fit together
- **Problem-solving:** Developing systematic approaches
- **Persistence:** Learning from trial and error
- **Visualization:** Mental rotation and transformation skills

**If your child struggles:**
- Use physical pieces (cut from paper or buy a set)
- Start with smaller grids (3√ó3, 4√ó4)
- Focus on one piece at a time
- Encourage rotation and flipping of pieces

**Making pentomino pieces:**
- Draw on graph paper and cut out
- Use 5 square blocks or tiles
- Make cardboard cutouts for durability
- Color-code different pieces

**Extension activities:**
- Try fitting all 12 pieces into rectangles (6√ó10, 5√ó12, 4√ó15, 3√ó20)
- Create pentomino puzzles for family members
- Build 3D structures with pentomino bases
- Design your own spatial puzzles

**Real-world connections:**
- **Tetris:** Video game based on similar spatial concepts
- **Architecture:** Fitting rooms and spaces together efficiently
- **Packing:** Arranging items in boxes or containers
- **Quilting:** Arranging fabric pieces in patterns

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child tries to force pieces that don't fit
  - **Help:** Encourage trying different orientations first
- **Mistake:** Child gets frustrated with complex puzzles
  - **Help:** Start with simpler 2-3 piece challenges
- **Mistake:** Child doesn't see all possible orientations
  - **Help:** Practice rotating and flipping individual pieces
