# Week 8 Day 2 – Strategy

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Fit an L-shaped pentomino and a T-shaped pentomino into a 5×5 grid leaving one square empty. Sketch where each piece goes.

## Guided Practice
1. Draw a 5×5 grid. Mark one spot where an L pentomino could fit.
2. How many squares does each pentomino cover?
3. Which two pentomino shapes can form a 5×2 rectangle together?
4. Try arranging F and Z shapes to cover a 5×4 board. Is it possible?
5. Name a pentomino that can tile a rectangle all by itself.

## Challenge
6. Find another way to fill a 5×5 board using exactly five pentominoes.

## Stretch / Colab
Run `nim_bot.py` and think about how the bot plans ahead.

## Exit Ticket
Write one question you still have about pentominoes.
