# W3 Day 2: Growing Shape Patterns

⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

---

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Creating Visual Growing Patterns**

Let's create a triangle pattern where each step adds one more triangle:

**Step 1:** △ (1 triangle)
**Step 2:** △△ (2 triangles)  
**Step 3:** △△△ (3 triangles)

**Pattern Rule:** Each step adds one more triangle than the previous step.

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Visual patterns help us see mathematical relationships and predict what comes next.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Design a pattern that could represent something growing in nature (like tree branches, flower petals, or bee colonies). Draw the first 4 steps and write the rule.

**Real-world connection:** Growing patterns appear everywhere - in nautilus shells, sunflower seeds, tree branches, and even in how cities expand!

**Paper Fallback:** Use graph paper to create an extended version of your favorite pattern. Try to continue it for at least 6 steps.
