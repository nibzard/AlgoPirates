# W3 Day 1: Skip Counting Patterns - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Complete these skip counting patterns:**
   a) 3, 6, 9, **12**, **15** (adding 3 each time)
   b) 10, 20, 30, **40**, **50** (adding 10 each time)

**Teaching Tip:** Help students visualize skip counting by drawing number lines or using hundreds charts. Emphasize that skip counting is the foundation for multiplication facts - 3, 6, 9, 12 is the same as 3×1, 3×2, 3×3, 3×4.

**2. Find the pattern and continue:**
   c) 7, 14, 21, **28**, **35** (adding 7 each time - multiples of 7)
   d) 15, 17, 19, **21**, **23** (adding 2 each time - odd numbers starting from 15)

**Teaching Tip:** Connect these patterns to multiplication tables. Pattern c) shows the 7 times table, while pattern d) demonstrates arithmetic sequences. Encourage students to look for the "jump" between consecutive numbers.

**3. Challenge pattern:**
   e) 1, 2, 4, 8, **16** (doubling each time - powers of 2)

**Teaching Tip:** This geometric pattern grows much faster than arithmetic patterns. Help students see that each number is double the previous one. Connect to real-world examples like cell division or paper folding.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample patterns that end with 24:**
- 6, 12, 18, 24 (skip counting by 6s)
- 8, 16, 24 (skip counting by 8s)  
- 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 (skip counting by 4s)
- 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 (skip counting by 3s)

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Solution

**Sample student response:** "Skip counting helps me in real life when I count money. If I have a pile of nickels, I can count by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20 instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... It's much faster! I also use it when I organize my baseball cards into groups of 9 - I can skip count to know how many cards I have total."

**Additional examples:**
- **Counting money:** "Skip counting by 5s helps count nickels quickly"
- **Organizing objects:** "When putting books in boxes of 6, I can skip count to know how many total books"
- **Time:** "Skip counting by 5s helps read minutes on a clock"
- **Sports:** "Counting basketball scores by 2s for regular baskets"

## 🏠 Teaching Tips for Parents

• **Common mistakes:** Students often confuse skip counting with regular counting. Help them see that we're making equal "jumps" on a number line rather than counting each number individually.
• **Visual support:** Use manipulatives like coins, blocks, or draw number lines. Group objects physically to show the skip counting pattern (3 groups of 4 = 4, 8, 12).
• **Real-world connections:** Point out skip counting in daily life - counting stairs by 2s, counting money by 5s and 10s, or organizing toys into equal groups.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with identifying the pattern rule:** Try this: Cover up all but the first three numbers. Ask "What do I add to 3 to get 6?" Then check if the same rule works for 6 to 9.

**If students struggle with continuing the pattern:** Try this: Have them write the addition explicitly: "12 + 3 = 15, 15 + 3 = 18" rather than just looking at the numbers.

**If students struggle with larger skip counting numbers:** Try this: Start with familiar patterns (2s, 5s, 10s) and use hundreds charts or number lines to show the jumps visually before moving to 7s or 8s.
