# W3 Day 2: Growing Shape Patterns - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Create a square pattern:**
   - Step 1: ☐ (1 square)
   - Step 2: ☐☐ (2 squares)
   - Step 3: **☐☐☐** (3 squares)
   - Rule: Add one more square each step

**2. Create a circle pattern:**
   - Step 1: ○ (1 circle)
   - Step 2: ○○○ (3 circles)
   - Step 3: **○○○○○** (5 circles)
   - Rule: Add 2 more circles each step (1, 3, 5, 7... - odd numbers)

**3. Challenge - Doubling pattern:**
   - Step 1: ★ (1 star)
   - Step 2: ★★ (2 stars)
   - Step 3: **★★★★** (4 stars)
   - Step 4: ★★★★★★★★ (8 stars)
   - Rule: Double the number of shapes each step (powers of 2)

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample nature patterns:**
- **Tree branches:** 1 trunk → 2 branches → 4 branches → 8 branches (doubling)
- **Flower petals:** 3 petals → 6 petals → 9 petals → 12 petals (adding 3)
- **Honeycomb cells:** 1 cell → 7 cells → 19 cells → 37 cells (hexagonal growth pattern)

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Sample Answers

- "My triangle pattern adds one triangle each time"
- "The star pattern doubles: 1, 2, 4, 8"
- "My flower grows by 3 petals each step"

## 💡 Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Visual patterns help children see mathematical relationships
- Growing patterns introduce concepts of addition, multiplication, and exponential growth
- Patterns in nature connect math to the real world

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simple +1 patterns before moving to +2 or doubling
- Use physical objects (blocks, coins) to build the patterns
- Draw each step clearly and count together

**Extension activities:**
- Look for patterns in everyday objects (floor tiles, brick walls)
- Use LEGO blocks to build 3D growing patterns
- Take photos of patterns found in nature

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child doesn't see the pattern rule
  - **Help:** Focus on the difference between consecutive steps
- **Mistake:** Pattern breaks down after a few steps
  - **Help:** Count the objects in each step together to verify the rule
