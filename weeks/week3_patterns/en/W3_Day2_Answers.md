# W3 Day 2: Growing Shape Patterns - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Create a square pattern:**
   - Step 1: ☐ (1 square)
   - Step 2: ☐☐ (2 squares)
   - Step 3: **☐☐☐** (3 squares)
   - Rule: Add one more square each step

**Teaching Tip:** Visual growing patterns help students understand arithmetic sequences concretely. This +1 pattern is the simplest growth pattern and prepares students for more complex sequences. Have students build these patterns with physical blocks to reinforce the concept.

**2. Create a circle pattern:**
   - Step 1: ○ (1 circle)
   - Step 2: ○○○ (3 circles)
   - Step 3: **○○○○○** (5 circles)
   - Rule: Add 2 more circles each step (1, 3, 5, 7... - odd numbers)

**Teaching Tip:** This pattern introduces the sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7...). Help students see that we're adding 2 each time, which creates the odd number pattern. Connect this to the mathematical concept that consecutive odd numbers differ by 2.

**3. Challenge - Doubling pattern:**
   - Step 1: ★ (1 star)
   - Step 2: ★★ (2 stars)
   - Step 3: **★★★★** (4 stars)
   - Step 4: ★★★★★★★★ (8 stars)
   - Rule: Double the number of shapes each step (powers of 2)

**Teaching Tip:** Geometric growth patterns like doubling grow much faster than arithmetic patterns. Use this to discuss exponential growth in nature (cell division, population growth). Students should recognize the pattern: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample nature patterns:**
- **Tree branches:** 1 trunk → 2 branches → 4 branches → 8 branches (doubling)
- **Flower petals:** 3 petals → 6 petals → 9 petals → 12 petals (adding 3)
- **Honeycomb cells:** 1 cell → 7 cells → 19 cells → 37 cells (hexagonal growth pattern)

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Solution

**Sample student response:** "I created a heart pattern that grows by 2 hearts each step: Step 1 has 1 heart, Step 2 has 3 hearts, Step 3 has 5 hearts. My rule is 'add 2 hearts each time' and I can predict that Step 4 will have 7 hearts. I drew it by starting with one heart, then adding two more hearts around it, then adding two more hearts to make it bigger."

**Additional examples:**
- "My triangle pattern adds one triangle each time"
- "The star pattern doubles: 1, 2, 4, 8"
- "My flower grows by 3 petals each step"

## 🏠 Teaching Tips for Parents

• **Common mistakes:** Students may lose track of the growth rule or confuse addition patterns with multiplication patterns. Help them build each step physically to see the growth.
• **Visual support:** Use blocks, coins, or drawings to make patterns concrete. Draw each step clearly and have students count the objects in each step to verify the rule.
• **Real-world connections:** Look for growing patterns in nature (tree branches, flower petals, shell spirals) and architecture (building floors, window arrangements).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with identifying the growth rule:** Try this: Have them count the objects in each step and write the numbers (1, 3, 5...). Then ask "What do I add to 1 to get 3? What do I add to 3 to get 5?"

**If students struggle with predicting the next step:** Try this: Have them physically build the pattern with blocks or coins. Guide them to add the right number of objects for the next step before drawing it.

**If students struggle with complex patterns like doubling:** Try this: Start with the doubling pattern using just 1, 2, 4 objects. Use repeated addition (2+2=4, 4+4=8) to show how doubling works before moving to larger numbers.
