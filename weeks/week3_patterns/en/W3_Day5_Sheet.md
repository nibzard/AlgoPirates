# W3 Day 5: Repeating Patterns

⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

---

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Creating and Analyzing Repeating Patterns**

Let's make a repeating pattern with letters: **A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, C...**

**Step 1:** Identify the core pattern
- The pattern unit is: **A, B, C** (3 elements)
- This unit repeats over and over

**Step 2:** Predict future elements
- Position 7: We need to find which element in the cycle
- 7 ÷ 3 = 2 remainder 1
- Remainder 1 means the 1st element of the cycle = **A**

**Step 3:** Count total repeats
- In 12 positions: 12 ÷ 3 = 4 complete cycles
- Pattern: A,B,C,A,B,C,A,B,C,A,B,C

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Repeating patterns help us predict what comes next and understand cycles in nature and mathematics.

## 📝 Guided Practice

**1. Complete the letter pattern:**
   A, A, B, A, A, B, _____, _____

**2. Create your own pattern:** Make a color pattern using three colors (red, blue, green). Show at least 8 terms.

**3. Sound pattern challenge:** Design a pattern using claps (C) and taps (T). Write the first 6 sounds.

**4. Pattern analysis:** For each pattern above, explain the rule in your own words.

**5. Prediction:** How many complete cycles of your color pattern would fit in 15 positions?

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Design a pattern puzzle for a family member! Create a repeating pattern, show them the first 6-8 terms, and challenge them to:
1. Find the rule
2. Predict the next 3 terms  
3. Tell you what the 20th term would be

**Real-world connection:** Repeating patterns appear in wallpaper, music, dance, seasons, and even in our daily routines!

**Colab Connection:** Use loops in programming to generate repeating patterns automatically.

**Paper Fallback:** Draw a decorative border pattern that could wrap around the edge of a page. Make sure it repeats perfectly!
