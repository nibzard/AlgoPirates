# W3 Day 3: Number Pattern Rules - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Find the rule and continue:**
   a) 1, 4, 7, **10**, **13** (add 3 each time)
   b) 12, 10, 8, **6**, **4** (subtract 2 each time)

**Teaching Tip:** These are arithmetic sequences - the most fundamental type of number pattern. Help students see that finding the common difference (what we add or subtract) is the key to understanding the pattern. Pattern (a) increases by 3, while pattern (b) decreases by 2.

**2. More challenging patterns:**
   c) 5, 10, 20, **40**, **80** (multiply by 2 each time - doubling)
   d) 9, 18, 27, **36**, **45** (add 9 each time - multiples of 9)

**Teaching Tip:** Pattern (c) is geometric (multiplying by 2), while pattern (d) is arithmetic (adding 9). Help students distinguish between these two types: geometric patterns grow much faster than arithmetic patterns. Pattern (d) connects to the 9 times table.

**3. Doubling pattern:**
   e) 3, 6, 12, 24, **48** (multiply by 2 each time)

**Teaching Tip:** This geometric sequence starts with 3 instead of 1, showing that doubling patterns can begin with any number. Help students see that 3×2=6, 6×2=12, 12×2=24, etc. Connect to real-world exponential growth.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample student-created patterns:**
- **Add 5:** 2, 7, 12, 17, 22
- **Multiply by 3:** 1, 3, 9, 27, 81
- **Add increasing amounts:** 1, 2, 4, 7, 11 (add 1, then 2, then 3, then 4...)
- **Subtract 4:** 20, 16, 12, 8, 4

**Pattern explanations should include:**
- The rule in words ("add 6 each time")
- How to apply the rule to find the next term
- Recognition that the rule works for all terms in the sequence

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Solution

**Sample student response:** "My favorite pattern rule is 'add 4 each time' because it's like counting by 4s but starting from any number. If I start with 3, I get 3, 7, 11, 15, 19... I can predict any number in the pattern by adding 4 repeatedly. I also learned that doubling patterns grow really fast - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 gets big quickly!"

**Additional examples:**
- "Add 3" (for arithmetic sequences)
- "Multiply by 2" (for geometric doubling)
- "Subtract 5" (for decreasing patterns)
- "Add the two previous numbers" (for Fibonacci-like patterns)

## 🏠 Teaching Tips for Parents

• **Common mistakes:** Students often identify a rule based on just the first two numbers without checking if it works for all terms. Teach them to verify their rule against at least three consecutive terms.
• **Visual support:** Use number lines to show arithmetic patterns (jumping by the same amount) and arrays or repeated groupings to show geometric patterns (multiplying).
• **Real-world connections:** Point out arithmetic patterns in addresses (2, 4, 6, 8 Elm Street), ages in families, or geometric patterns in savings account growth with interest.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with finding the rule:** Try this: Have them write the differences between consecutive terms: 1→4, 4→7, 7→10. If differences are the same (+3), it's arithmetic. If not, check if it's geometric (multiply/divide).

**If students struggle with continuing patterns:** Try this: Once they find the rule, have them write it as an operation: "10 + 3 = 13, 13 + 3 = 16" rather than just trying to see the next number.

**If students struggle with geometric vs arithmetic patterns:** Try this: For geometric patterns, show the repeated multiplication explicitly: 5×2=10, 10×2=20, 20×2=40. For arithmetic, show the repeated addition: 9+9=18, 18+9=27, 27+9=36.
