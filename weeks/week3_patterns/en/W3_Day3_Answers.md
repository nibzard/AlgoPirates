# W3 Day 3: Number Pattern Rules - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Find the rule and continue:**
   a) 1, 4, 7, **10**, **13** (add 3 each time)
   b) 12, 10, 8, **6**, **4** (subtract 2 each time)

**2. More challenging patterns:**
   c) 5, 10, 20, **40**, **80** (multiply by 2 each time - doubling)
   d) 9, 18, 27, **36**, **45** (add 9 each time - multiples of 9)

**3. Doubling pattern:**
   e) 3, 6, 12, 24, **48** (multiply by 2 each time)

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample student-created patterns:**
- **Add 5:** 2, 7, 12, 17, 22
- **Multiply by 3:** 1, 3, 9, 27, 81
- **Add increasing amounts:** 1, 2, 4, 7, 11 (add 1, then 2, then 3, then 4...)
- **Subtract 4:** 20, 16, 12, 8, 4

**Pattern explanations should include:**
- The rule in words ("add 6 each time")
- How to apply the rule to find the next term
- Recognition that the rule works for all terms in the sequence

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Sample Answers

- "Add 3" (for arithmetic sequences)
- "Multiply by 2" (for geometric doubling)
- "Subtract 5" (for decreasing patterns)
- "Add the two previous numbers" (for Fibonacci-like patterns)

## 💡 Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Pattern rules describe the mathematical relationship between consecutive terms
- Common rules include: add/subtract a constant, multiply/divide by a constant
- Some patterns involve more complex rules (like adding increasing amounts)

**Pattern types to recognize:**
- **Arithmetic:** Same number added each time (3, 6, 9, 12...)
- **Geometric:** Same number multiplied each time (2, 6, 18, 54...)
- **Decreasing:** Number gets smaller by a consistent rule

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simple +1 or +2 patterns
- Use finger counting or objects to show the differences
- Focus on just the first 3 terms to identify the rule

**Advanced challenges:**
- Try patterns with two operations (add 2, then multiply by 2)
- Explore patterns in multiplication tables
- Look for patterns in calendar dates or addresses

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child sees pattern but can't continue
  - **Help:** Write out the operation explicitly: "7 + 3 = 10"
- **Mistake:** Child finds wrong rule
  - **Help:** Check the rule against all given terms, not just the first two
