## 🔍 Worked Example

**Finding and Continuing Skip Counting Patterns**

Let's look at this sequence: **4, 8, 12, ?, ?**

**Step 1:** Find the pattern
- From 4 to 8: we add 4
- From 8 to 12: we add 4 again
- The pattern is: **add 4 each time**

**Step 2:** Continue the pattern
- 12 + 4 = 16
- 16 + 4 = 20

**Answer:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 20

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Look for patterns by checking what happens between consecutive numbers.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Create a pattern investigation! Find three different skip counting patterns that end with the number 24.

**Real-world connection:** Skip counting helps us count money (by 5s for nickels, by 10s for dimes), organize items in groups, and understand multiplication tables.

**Paper Fallback:** Create your own skip counting sequence starting with any number from 1-10, and continue it for at least 6 terms. Circle the pattern rule you used.
