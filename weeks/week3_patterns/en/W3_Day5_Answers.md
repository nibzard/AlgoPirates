# W3 Day 5: Repeating Patterns - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Complete the letter pattern:**
   A, A, B, A, A, B, **A**, **A**
   - Pattern rule: Two A's, then one B, repeating
   - Pattern unit: A, A, B (length 3)

**Teaching Tip:** Repeating patterns have a "core unit" that cycles continuously. Help students identify the shortest repeating unit first (A, A, B), then extend by repeating this unit. This prepares students for periodic functions in higher mathematics.

**2. Create your own pattern:** 
   Sample answer: Red, Blue, Green, Red, Blue, Green, Red, Blue
   - Students should show at least 8 terms with a clear repeating cycle
   - Accept any consistent 3-color pattern

**Teaching Tip:** Student-created patterns allow for creativity while reinforcing the mathematical concept. Encourage students to use patterns from their own experience (days of the week, meal rotations, clothing patterns).

**3. Sound pattern challenge:**
   Sample answer: C, T, T, C, T, T (Clap, Tap, Tap repeating)
   - Accept any consistent pattern using C and T
   - Pattern should be clearly repeatable

**Teaching Tip:** Sound patterns engage kinesthetic learners and connect to music and rhythm. Have students perform their patterns aloud to verify they repeat correctly. This multi-sensory approach reinforces pattern recognition.

**4. Pattern analysis:**
   - Pattern 1: "Two A's followed by one B, then repeat"
   - Pattern 2: "Three colors in order, then start over"  
   - Pattern 3: "One clap, two taps, then repeat"

**5. Prediction:**
   For a 3-color pattern: 15 √∑ 3 = 5 complete cycles fit exactly in 15 positions

**Teaching Tip:** Pattern prediction using division introduces modular arithmetic concepts. When the pattern length divides evenly into the position number, you get the last element of the pattern unit. When there's a remainder, count that many positions into the pattern unit.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample pattern puzzles:**
- **Shape pattern:** ‚óã‚ñ≥‚ñ°‚óã‚ñ≥‚ñ°‚óã‚ñ≥ (circle, triangle, square repeating)
- **Number pattern:** 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2 (alternating 1 and 2)
- **Mixed pattern:** X,X,O,X,X,O,X,X (two X's, one O)

**For finding the 20th term:**
- Pattern length 3: 20 √∑ 3 = 6 remainder 2, so it's the 2nd element
- Pattern length 2: 20 √∑ 2 = 10 remainder 0, so it's the last element

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Sample student response:** "My favorite type of repeating pattern was the sound patterns because I could clap and tap them out loud! I made a pattern that went Clap-Clap-Snap-Clap-Clap-Snap, and I could predict that the 10th sound would be Snap because 10 √∑ 3 = 3 remainder 1, so I count 1 position into my pattern: Clap. Wait, that's wrong - let me recount: positions 1,2,3 are Clap-Clap-Snap, positions 4,5,6 are Clap-Clap-Snap, so position 10 would be Clap!"

**Additional examples:**
- **Letter patterns:** "I liked making letter patterns because I could use my name"
- **Color patterns:** "Colors were fun because I could imagine a rainbow"
- **Sound patterns:** "I enjoyed sound patterns because I could perform them"
- **Visual patterns:** "Drawing patterns was relaxing and creative"

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

‚Ä¢ **Common mistakes:** Students often identify patterns that are too long (not finding the shortest repeating unit) or lose track when predicting distant positions. Help them find the core unit first, then use division to find positions.
‚Ä¢ **Visual support:** Use colored objects, draw pattern strips, or create pattern charts. Physical manipulation helps students see the repetition clearly. Consider using rhythm instruments for sound patterns.
‚Ä¢ **Real-world connections:** Point out repeating patterns everywhere - wallpaper designs, clothing patterns, weekly schedules, seasonal cycles, and musical rhythms in their favorite songs.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with finding the repeating unit:** Try this: Have them look for where the pattern starts over again. Cover up everything after the first repetition and ask "What's the smallest piece that repeats?" Start with very simple AB patterns before moving to longer units.

**If students struggle with predicting distant positions:** Try this: Show them the division method step by step: "To find position 17 in an ABC pattern: 17 √∑ 3 = 5 remainder 2, so count 2 positions into ABC: A(1), B(2). The answer is B."

**If students struggle with creating their own patterns:** Try this: Start by having them copy existing patterns (like stripes on their shirt), then modify one element to make it their own. Give them concrete objects to arrange in patterns before moving to abstract symbols.
