# W3 Day 5: Repeating Patterns - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Complete the letter pattern:**
   A, A, B, A, A, B, **A**, **A**
   - Pattern rule: Two A's, then one B, repeating
   - Pattern unit: A, A, B (length 3)

**2. Create your own pattern:** 
   Sample answer: Red, Blue, Green, Red, Blue, Green, Red, Blue
   - Students should show at least 8 terms with a clear repeating cycle
   - Accept any consistent 3-color pattern

**3. Sound pattern challenge:**
   Sample answer: C, T, T, C, T, T (Clap, Tap, Tap repeating)
   - Accept any consistent pattern using C and T
   - Pattern should be clearly repeatable

**4. Pattern analysis:**
   - Pattern 1: "Two A's followed by one B, then repeat"
   - Pattern 2: "Three colors in order, then start over"  
   - Pattern 3: "One clap, two taps, then repeat"

**5. Prediction:**
   For a 3-color pattern: 15 ÷ 3 = 5 complete cycles fit exactly in 15 positions

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample pattern puzzles:**
- **Shape pattern:** ○△□○△□○△ (circle, triangle, square repeating)
- **Number pattern:** 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2 (alternating 1 and 2)
- **Mixed pattern:** X,X,O,X,X,O,X,X (two X's, one O)

**For finding the 20th term:**
- Pattern length 3: 20 ÷ 3 = 6 remainder 2, so it's the 2nd element
- Pattern length 2: 20 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 0, so it's the last element

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Sample Answers

- **Letter patterns:** "I liked making letter patterns because I could use my name"
- **Color patterns:** "Colors were fun because I could imagine a rainbow"
- **Sound patterns:** "I enjoyed sound patterns because I could perform them"
- **Visual patterns:** "Drawing patterns was relaxing and creative"

## 💡 Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Repeating patterns have a core unit that cycles continuously
- We can predict any position in the pattern using division and remainders
- Patterns help us organize and understand regularity in our world

**Types of repeating patterns:**
- **Simple alternating:** A,B,A,B,A,B... (length 2)
- **Three-part:** A,B,C,A,B,C,A,B,C... (length 3)
- **Complex:** A,A,B,C,A,A,B,C... (length 4)

**Finding pattern rules:**
1. Look for the shortest repeating unit
2. Count how many elements are in one cycle
3. Test the rule on several cycles to confirm

**Real-world pattern hunting:**
- **Nature:** Day/night, seasons, flower petals
- **Music:** Beats, choruses, rhythms
- **Architecture:** Brick patterns, tile designs
- **Daily life:** Weekly schedules, meal rotations

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simple 2-element patterns (A,B,A,B...)
- Use physical objects to show the repetition
- Clap or tap out rhythm patterns together
- Look for patterns in familiar songs or rhymes

**Advanced challenges:**
- Create patterns within patterns (A,B,B,C,A,B,B,C...)
- Find patterns that have different lengths (3-part, then 4-part)
- Design patterns that tell a story or represent something meaningful

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child can't find the repeating unit
  - **Help:** Cover later terms and focus on finding what repeats first
- **Mistake:** Child loses track of position in cycle
  - **Help:** Use fingers to count through the pattern unit repeatedly
