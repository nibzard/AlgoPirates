## 🔍 Worked Example

**Finding Pattern Rules in Number Sequences**

Let's find the rule for this sequence: **2, 5, 8, 11, ?**

**Step 1:** Look at the differences between consecutive numbers
- 5 - 2 = 3
- 8 - 5 = 3  
- 11 - 8 = 3

**Step 2:** Identify the pattern
- The difference is always 3
- **Rule:** "Add 3 each time"

**Step 3:** Continue the pattern
- 11 + 3 = 14

**Answer:** 2, 5, 8, 11, 14

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** When looking for patterns, always check what operation connects one term to the next.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Create your own number pattern with a clear rule. Write the first 5 numbers, then challenge a family member to find your rule and continue the pattern!

**Real-world connection:** Pattern rules help us predict growth in savings accounts, population changes, and even sports statistics!

**Colab Connection:** Today's activity uses `life_sim.py` to explore how simple rules create complex patterns in nature.

**Paper Fallback:** Create a number puzzle by giving someone the first 4 terms of your pattern and asking them to find the next 2 terms.
