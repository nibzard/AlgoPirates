# Week 3 Day 4 – Patterns

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Study a 3×3 grid with one live cell in the centre. After one step of Conway's rules, the cell dies because it has no neighbours.

## Guided Practice
1. Sketch a 3×3 grid with three cells in a row. What happens after one step?
2. Try an L shape of three cells. Predict the next step.
3. How many neighbours keep a cell alive?
4. What causes a dead cell to come to life?
5. Can a pattern repeat forever?

## Challenge
6. Find a starting pattern that disappears after two steps.
7. Explain why it vanishes.

## Stretch / Colab
Run `life_sim.py` and experiment with different starting grids.

## Exit Ticket
Write one question you have about the Game of Life.

## Paper Fallback – Reverse Side
Draw a 5×5 grid. Show two steps of a pattern without using a computer.
