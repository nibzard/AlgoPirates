# Week 2 Day 4 â€“ Fractions

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Decide which is larger, \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) or \(\tfrac{1}{3}\).

On a number line, \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) lies to the right of \(\tfrac{1}{3}\), so it is greater.

## Guided Practice
1. Which is greater: \(\tfrac{2}{5}\) or \(\tfrac{3}{5}\)?
2. Order from least to greatest: \(\tfrac{1}{6},\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{4}\).
3. Which is smaller: \(\tfrac{4}{8}\) or \(\tfrac{3}{8}\)?
4. Place these on a number line: \(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{4},\tfrac{3}{4}\).
5. Which is closer to 1: \(\tfrac{5}{6}\) or \(\tfrac{4}{6}\)?

## Challenge
6. Arrange \(\tfrac{2}{3},\tfrac{3}{4},\tfrac{1}{2}\) from least to greatest.
7. How can you compare fractions that have unlike denominators?
8. Create two fractions that are equal and explain why.

## Stretch / Colab
Open `fraction_wall.ipynb` and check which rows show fractions getting larger.
If you can't run the code, describe what the output should look like.

## Exit Ticket
Write down a real-world situation where comparing fractions is useful.
