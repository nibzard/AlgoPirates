# Week 2 Day 5 – Fractions

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: You ate \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) of a pizza and your friend ate \(\tfrac{2}{4}\). How much was eaten in total?

Add the fractions: \(1/4+2/4=3/4\). Three quarters of the pizza was eaten.

## Guided Practice
1. You drank \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) of a carton of milk in the morning and \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) in the afternoon. How much did you drink?
2. A rope is \(1\) meter long. You used \(\tfrac{2}{5}\) of it. How much is left?
3. A recipe needs \(\tfrac{3}{8}\) cup of sugar. You only have \(\tfrac{1}{8}\). How much more do you need?
4. You read \(\tfrac{2}{6}\) of a book on Monday and \(\tfrac{3}{6}\) on Tuesday. Did you finish it?
5. A tank is \(\tfrac{5}{8}\) full. You use \(\tfrac{2}{8}\). What fraction remains?

## Challenge
6. Write a short word problem that uses fractions.
7. Explain why fractions are handy for measuring ingredients.
8. What fraction of the week is five days?
