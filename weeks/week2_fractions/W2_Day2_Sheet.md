# Week 2 Day 2 â€“ Fractions

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Use a fraction wall to show that \(\tfrac{2}{4}=\tfrac{1}{2}\).

On the wall, the bar split in four pieces lines up exactly with the half bar.

## Guided Practice
1. Find an equivalent fraction for \(\tfrac{1}{3}\).
2. Find an equivalent fraction for \(\tfrac{3}{6}\).
3. Which fraction is equal to \(\tfrac{2}{8}\)?
4. Draw two fractions that are equal to \(\tfrac{1}{2}\).
5. Which is larger on the wall, \(\tfrac{3}{4}\) or \(\tfrac{6}{8}\)?

## Challenge
6. Give another name for \(\tfrac{4}{6}\).
7. Explain how the fraction wall helps you find equivalents.
8. Can \(\tfrac{5}{10}\) be simplified? Why or why not?

## Stretch / Colab
Open `fraction_wall.ipynb` and color the bars that match \(\tfrac{1}{2}\).
If you can't run the code, describe what the output should look like.

## Exit Ticket
Write one question you still have about equivalent fractions.
