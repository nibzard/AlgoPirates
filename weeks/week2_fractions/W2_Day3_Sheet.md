# Week 2 Day 3 â€“ Fractions

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Add \(\tfrac{1}{4}+\tfrac{2}{4}\).

When denominators match, add the numerators: \(1+2=3\), so the sum is \(\tfrac{3}{4}\).

## Guided Practice
1. \(\tfrac{1}{5}+\tfrac{1}{5}=\) ____
2. \(\tfrac{2}{6}+\tfrac{3}{6}=\) ____
3. \(\tfrac{4}{8}+\tfrac{1}{8}=\) ____
4. \(\tfrac{3}{7}+\tfrac{2}{7}=\) ____
5. \(\tfrac{5}{9}+\tfrac{1}{9}=\) ____

## Challenge
6. \(\tfrac{2}{4}+\tfrac{1}{4}=\) ____
7. What stays the same when adding like fractions?
8. Write your own example of adding fractions with the same denominator.

## Stretch / Colab
Open `fraction_wall.ipynb` and try adding colored bars to match these sums.
If you can't run the code, describe what the output should look like.

## Exit Ticket
Which fraction sum today felt easiest? Why?
