# W2 Day 2: Equivalent Fractions - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Using the fraction wall:**
Find an equivalent fraction for \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) by looking at the sixths row. Answer: \(\tfrac{1}{3} = \tfrac{\_\_}{6}\)

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{1}{3} = \tfrac{2}{6}\)

**Teaching Tip:** Use the fraction wall to show that when you have 1 piece out of 3, it lines up exactly with 2 pieces out of 6. Point out the visual alignment - they cover the same length. This is the foundation of equivalent fraction understanding.

**2. Simplifying fractions:**
Find an equivalent fraction for \(\tfrac{3}{6}\) by reducing to lowest terms. Answer: \(\tfrac{3}{6} = \tfrac{\_\_}{\_\_}\)

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{3}{6} = \tfrac{1}{2}\)

**Teaching Tip:** Show the division process: both 3 and 6 can be divided by 3. So \(\tfrac{3√∑3}{6√∑3} = \tfrac{1}{2}\). Emphasize that we're finding the "simplest form" - the smallest numbers that represent the same amount.

**3. Multiple equivalents:**
Which fraction is equal to \(\tfrac{2}{8}\)? Choose from: \(\tfrac{1}{4}\), \(\tfrac{1}{3}\), or \(\tfrac{3}{12}\). Explain your choice.

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) is equal to \(\tfrac{2}{8}\)

**Teaching Tip:** Show the relationship: \(\tfrac{2}{8} = \tfrac{2√∑2}{8√∑2} = \tfrac{1}{4}\). You can also verify by cross-multiplication: 2 √ó 4 = 8 √ó 1. Visual models help - both fractions represent the same shaded area.

**4. Creative representations:**
Draw two different fractions that are equal to \(\tfrac{1}{2}\). Use different shapes or different denominators.

**Answer:** Examples include \(\tfrac{2}{4}\), \(\tfrac{3}{6}\), \(\tfrac{4}{8}\), \(\tfrac{5}{10}\), etc. Students should draw different shapes (circles, rectangles, bars) showing equivalent amounts.

**Teaching Tip:** Encourage students to verify their equivalence by checking that the shaded portions look the same size. This builds visual intuition for equivalent fractions.

**5. Comparing equivalents:**
Using the fraction wall, which is larger: \(\tfrac{3}{4}\) or \(\tfrac{6}{8}\)? How can you tell?

**Answer:** They are equal! \(\tfrac{3}{4} = \tfrac{6}{8}\)

**Teaching Tip:** On the fraction wall, these segments line up exactly. Mathematically: \(\tfrac{3}{4} = \tfrac{3√ó2}{4√ó2} = \tfrac{6}{8}\). This demonstrates that equivalent fractions represent the same quantity even though they look different.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Write one question you still have about equivalent fractions, or explain one new thing you discovered about how fractions can be equal even when they look different.

**Sample Answers:**
- **Discovery:** "I learned that \(\tfrac{2}{4}\) and \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) are the same amount even though the numbers are different!"
- **Question:** "How do you know if two fractions are equivalent without using a fraction wall?"
- **Discovery:** "When you multiply or divide both the top and bottom by the same number, you get an equivalent fraction"
- **Question:** "Are there infinite equivalent fractions for every fraction?"

**Teaching Tip:** Validate both questions and discoveries. Questions show engagement, while discoveries demonstrate understanding. Use their questions to guide future lessons.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Multiplication/Division Rule:** When creating equivalent fractions, both numerator and denominator must be multiplied or divided by the same non-zero number
- **Visual Verification:** Always encourage drawing or using physical models to verify that equivalent fractions represent the same amount
- **Kitchen Connections:** Use measuring cups to show equivalents: \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) cup = \(\tfrac{2}{4}\) cup = \(\tfrac{4}{8}\) cup
- **Pattern Recognition:** Help students notice patterns in equivalent fraction families (2/4, 3/6, 4/8, 5/10...)

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Finding equivalent fractions
**Try this:** Start with doubling - show how \(\tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{2}{4}\) by doubling both numbers. This is the easiest equivalent fraction pattern to understand.

**If students struggle with:** Understanding why equivalent fractions are equal
**Try this:** Use concrete manipulatives like fraction bars, paper folding, or pizza models. The visual and tactile experience makes the concept concrete.

**If students struggle with:** Simplifying fractions
**Try this:** Introduce the "greatest common factor" concept gradually. Start with obvious factors (both numbers are even, both end in 5, etc.) before formal GCF methods.

**If students struggle with:** Recognizing when fractions are equivalent
**Try this:** Teach cross-multiplication as a checking method: \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) and \(\tfrac{3}{6}\) are equivalent because 1√ó6 = 2√ó3. But always pair this with visual verification.
