## üîç Worked Example

**Creating and Understanding Fractions**

Your mission: Shade \(\tfrac{3}{4}\) of a pizza to understand what fractions represent.

**Step 1:** Understand what the fraction means
- The bottom number (4) tells us how many **equal parts** the whole is divided into
- The top number (3) tells us how many of those parts we're focusing on

**Step 2:** Create the visual representation
- Draw a circle to represent the whole pizza
- Divide it into 4 equal slices (like cutting with two perpendicular lines)
- Shade exactly 3 of those slices

**Step 3:** Verify your understanding
- Count: 3 shaded parts out of 4 total parts = \(\tfrac{3}{4}\)
- Notice: All parts must be equal in size for the fraction to be accurate

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** When we create visual models of fractions, we're building concrete understanding of abstract mathematical relationships.

## üìù Guided Practice

**1. Basic fraction identification:**
Draw and shade \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) of a circle. How many equal parts will you create?

**2. Building complexity:**
Draw \(\tfrac{2}{3}\) of a rectangle. Explain your strategy for making equal parts.

**3. Reading from visuals:**
If you see 5 shaded pieces out of 6 total equal pieces, write this as a fraction: _____

**4. Different shapes, same concept:**
Draw \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) of a square. Compare this to your \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) circle - which represents more?

**5. Practice with eighths:**
Write the fraction that represents 2 shaded parts out of 8 equal parts: _____

## üöÄ Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Open `fraction_wall.ipynb` and build a wall of sixths. Look for patterns in how the wall segments align with other fraction rows.

**Guiding questions for the notebook:**
- How do the sixth segments compare to the half and third segments?
- What happens when you line up different rows of the fraction wall?

**Paper Fallback:** Create your own fraction wall on paper. Draw rows showing halves, thirds, fourths, and sixths. Circle the segments that align perfectly and explain what this tells you about equivalent fractions.

**Real-world connection:** Think about pizza slices, pie pieces, or chocolate bar sections. When have you seen fractions in your daily life?
