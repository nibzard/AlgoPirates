## üîç Worked Example

**Solving Real-World Problems with Fractions**

Your mission: You ate \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) of a pizza and your friend ate \(\tfrac{2}{4}\) of the same pizza. How much was eaten in total, and how does this connect to everyday life?

**Step 1:** Understand the problem situation
- We have one whole pizza divided into equal parts
- Two people ate different amounts of the same pizza
- We need to find the total amount consumed

**Step 2:** Set up the mathematical solution
- Your portion: \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) of the pizza
- Friend's portion: \(\tfrac{2}{4}\) of the pizza
- Total eaten = \(\tfrac{1}{4} + \tfrac{2}{4}\)
- Since denominators are the same, add numerators: 1 + 2 = 3
- Total eaten = \(\tfrac{3}{4}\) of the pizza

**Step 3:** Interpret the result
- Three-quarters of the pizza was consumed
- One-quarter (\(\tfrac{1}{4}\)) of the pizza remains
- We can verify: \(\tfrac{3}{4} + \tfrac{1}{4} = \tfrac{4}{4} = 1\) whole pizza ‚úì

**Step 4:** Connect to real-world reasoning
- This helps with planning: "Do we have enough pizza for everyone?"
- It helps with fairness: "Did everyone get a fair share?"
- It connects to waste management: "How much is left over?"

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Word problems help us see how mathematical operations connect to everyday decisions and problem-solving.

## üìù Guided Practice

**1. Daily consumption:**
You drank \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) of a carton of milk in the morning and \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) in the afternoon. How much did you drink total? What fraction is left?

**2. Resource management:**
A rope is 1 meter long. You used \(\tfrac{2}{5}\) of it for a project. How much rope is left for other uses?

**3. Cooking preparation:**
A recipe needs \(\tfrac{3}{8}\) cup of sugar. You only have \(\tfrac{1}{8}\) cup available. How much more sugar do you need to buy?

**4. Reading progress:**
You read \(\tfrac{2}{6}\) of a book on Monday and \(\tfrac{3}{6}\) on Tuesday. Did you finish the entire book? How do you know?

**5. Resource depletion:**
A water tank is \(\tfrac{5}{8}\) full. You use \(\tfrac{2}{8}\) of the tank's capacity for watering plants. What fraction of the tank's capacity remains?

## üöÄ Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Open `fraction_wall.ipynb` and use the visual fraction bars to model and solve one of today's word problems. See how the visual representation helps verify your algebraic solution.

**Extended investigations:**
- Create your own word problem involving fractions and model it with the fraction wall
- Investigate what happens when the sum of fractions equals exactly 1 (a whole)
- Explore problems where you need to find "how much more" or "how much less"

**Paper Fallback:** Choose one of today's word problems and create a visual story. Draw pictures showing the initial situation, the action that happens, and the final result. Include fraction labels for each stage.

**Real-world connections:**
- Cooking and baking: measuring ingredients, scaling recipes
- Time management: "I spent \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) of my day on homework"
- Sports: "Our team won \(\tfrac{3}{5}\) of our games this season"
- Money: "I saved \(\tfrac{2}{3}\) of my allowance"

## üéØ Exit Ticket

Name one place outside school where you see fractions being used. Explain why fractions are helpful in that situation and what might happen if people didn't understand fractions.

**Bonus reflection:** What fraction of this week's math work focused on fractions? (Hint: Think about how many days this week we studied fractions compared to the total days.)
