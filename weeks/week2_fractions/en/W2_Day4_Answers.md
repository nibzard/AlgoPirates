# W2 Day 4: Comparing and Ordering Fractions - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Same denominator comparison:**
Which is greater: \(\tfrac{2}{5}\) or \(\tfrac{3}{5}\)? Explain your reasoning without drawing pictures.

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{3}{5}\) is greater than \(\tfrac{2}{5}\)

**Teaching Tip:** When denominators are the same, we're comparing pieces of the same size. Since 3 > 2, having 3 pieces is more than having 2 pieces. This is the easiest type of fraction comparison.

**2. Different denominators (unit fractions):**
Order from least to greatest: \(\tfrac{1}{6}, \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}\)

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{1}{6}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{1}{2}\)

**Teaching Tip:** For unit fractions (numerator = 1), the larger the denominator, the smaller the fraction. Think of it as: "1 piece out of 6" is smaller than "1 piece out of 4" which is smaller than "1 piece out of 2." The more pieces you divide the whole into, the smaller each piece becomes.

**3. Same denominator, smaller values:**
Which is smaller: \(\tfrac{4}{8}\) or \(\tfrac{3}{8}\)? How do you know?

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{3}{8}\) is smaller than \(\tfrac{4}{8}\)

**Teaching Tip:** Again, same denominators mean same-sized pieces. Since 3 < 4, we have fewer pieces. You can also note that \(\tfrac{4}{8} = \tfrac{1}{2}\), so we're comparing \(\tfrac{3}{8}\) to \(\tfrac{1}{2}\).

**4. Number line practice:**
Draw a number line from 0 to 1. Place and label these fractions: \(\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{3}{4}\)

**Answer:** Number line with \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) at the quarter mark, \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) at the halfway mark, and \(\tfrac{3}{4}\) at the three-quarters mark.

**Teaching Tip:** The number line is a powerful tool for fraction comparison. Students should see that fractions to the right are larger than fractions to the left. This visual representation supports their numerical understanding.

**5. Proximity to 1:**
Which is closer to 1: \(\tfrac{5}{6}\) or \(\tfrac{4}{6}\)? How far is each fraction from 1?

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{5}{6}\) is closer to 1. \(\tfrac{5}{6}\) is \(\tfrac{1}{6}\) away from 1, while \(\tfrac{4}{6}\) is \(\tfrac{2}{6}\) away from 1.

**Teaching Tip:** This introduces the concept of "distance from 1." To find how far a fraction is from 1, subtract it from 1: \(1 - \tfrac{5}{6} = \tfrac{1}{6}\) vs. \(1 - \tfrac{4}{6} = \tfrac{2}{6}\).

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Write down a real-world situation where comparing fractions would be useful. Explain which fractions you might need to compare and why it matters to know which is larger.

**Sample Answers:**
- **Cooking:** "If a recipe calls for \(\tfrac{3}{4}\) cup of flour and I only have \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) cup, I need to know that \(\tfrac{3}{4} > \tfrac{1}{2}\) so I know I don't have enough"
- **Time management:** "If I have \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) of my homework done and my friend has \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) done, comparing shows my friend is further along"
- **Sports:** "Comparing batting averages like \(\tfrac{3}{8}\) vs \(\tfrac{2}{5}\) to see which player is performing better"
- **Sharing:** "If one pizza is \(\tfrac{3}{4}\) eaten and another is \(\tfrac{2}{3}\) eaten, knowing which is more eaten helps decide which to finish first"

**Teaching Tip:** Real-world applications help students see the practical value of mathematics. Celebrate creative examples while ensuring the fraction comparison is mathematically sound.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Benchmark Fractions:** Help students compare fractions to \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) - is the fraction less than, equal to, or greater than half?
- **Visual Strategies:** When denominators are different, drawing helps more than abstract rules
- **Common Denominators:** For advanced students, show how to convert fractions to common denominators for easier comparison
- **Number Line Practice:** Use a number line on paper or tape on the floor to make fraction positions concrete

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Comparing fractions with different denominators
**Try this:** Start with visual models - draw identical shapes divided differently. Focus on which shaded region is larger before introducing numerical strategies.

**If students struggle with:** Unit fraction comparisons (like \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) vs \(\tfrac{1}{6}\))
**Try this:** Use the "pizza slice" analogy. "Would you rather have 1 slice of a pizza cut into 4 pieces or 1 slice of a pizza cut into 6 pieces?" The 4-piece slice is bigger.

**If students struggle with:** Placing fractions on a number line
**Try this:** Start with halves and quarters only. Mark \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) first, then \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) and \(\tfrac{3}{4}\). Build confidence before adding other fractions.

**If students struggle with:** Understanding "closer to 1"
**Try this:** Use physical distance. If a fraction is \(\tfrac{5}{6}\), show that it's only \(\tfrac{1}{6}\) away from the whole. Use manipulatives to show this "gap" visually.
