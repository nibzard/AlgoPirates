# W2 Day 5: Fractions in Real-World Problem Solving - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Daily consumption:**
You drank \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) of a carton of milk in the morning and \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) in the afternoon. How much did you drink total? What fraction is left?

**Answer:** Total consumed: \(\tfrac{1}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3} = \tfrac{2}{3}\). Remaining: \(\tfrac{1}{3}\)

**Teaching Tip:** This reinforces addition of like fractions in a real context. Students can verify: \(\tfrac{2}{3} + \tfrac{1}{3} = \tfrac{3}{3} = 1\) whole carton. The visual of a milk carton divided into thirds helps make this concrete.

**2. Resource management:**
A rope is 1 meter long. You used \(\tfrac{2}{5}\) of it for a project. How much rope is left for other uses?

**Answer:** \(1 - \tfrac{2}{5} = \tfrac{5}{5} - \tfrac{2}{5} = \tfrac{3}{5}\) meter left

**Teaching Tip:** This introduces subtraction from 1 whole. Show that 1 = \(\tfrac{5}{5}\) when working with fifths. This prepares students for mixed number work and helps them see that 1 can be written as any fraction where numerator equals denominator.

**3. Cooking preparation:**
A recipe needs \(\tfrac{3}{8}\) cup of sugar. You only have \(\tfrac{1}{8}\) cup available. How much more sugar do you need to buy?

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{3}{8} - \tfrac{1}{8} = \tfrac{2}{8} = \tfrac{1}{4}\) cup more needed

**Teaching Tip:** This is subtraction of like fractions. Students can think of it as "I need 3 pieces but only have 1 piece, so I need 2 more pieces." The simplification to \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) connects to equivalent fractions from Day 2.

**4. Reading progress:**
You read \(\tfrac{2}{6}\) of a book on Monday and \(\tfrac{3}{6}\) on Tuesday. Did you finish the entire book? How do you know?

**Answer:** No, you didn't finish. \(\tfrac{2}{6} + \tfrac{3}{6} = \tfrac{5}{6}\) of the book. \(\tfrac{1}{6}\) remains unread.

**Teaching Tip:** This problem requires students to interpret their answer. \(\tfrac{5}{6}\) is close to 1 but not equal to 1. This builds fraction sense - understanding how close to "complete" they are.

**5. Resource depletion:**
A water tank is \(\tfrac{5}{8}\) full. You use \(\tfrac{2}{8}\) of the tank's capacity for watering plants. What fraction of the tank's capacity remains?

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{5}{8} - \tfrac{2}{8} = \tfrac{3}{8}\) of the tank's capacity remains

**Teaching Tip:** Distinguish between "fraction of tank capacity" and "fraction of current water." This problem asks about tank capacity, so we subtract from the original \(\tfrac{5}{8}\), not from 1 whole. This distinction is important for real-world problem solving.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Name one place outside school where you see fractions being used. Explain why fractions are helpful in that situation and what might happen if people didn't understand fractions.

**Sample Answers:**
- **Cooking:** "Recipes use fractions like \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) cup flour. Without understanding fractions, your food might taste terrible or not bake properly"
- **Medicine:** "Doctors give \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) of a pill to children. Wrong fractions could be dangerous"
- **Sports:** "Baseball batting averages are fractions. Without them, we couldn't compare players fairly"
- **Construction:** "Builders measure lumber in fractions of inches. Without fractions, nothing would fit together properly"

**Bonus reflection:** What fraction of this week's math work focused on fractions?

**Answer:** All 5 days focused on fractions, so \(\tfrac{5}{5} = 1\) whole week (or 100%) was about fractions.

**Teaching Tip:** The bonus question helps students see fractions in their immediate environment and reinforces that \(\tfrac{5}{5} = 1\).

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Word Problem Strategy:** Read the problem twice - once for understanding, once for identifying the mathematical operation needed
- **Real-World Connections:** Point out fraction use in daily life - cooking, time management, shopping discounts, gas tank levels
- **Estimation Skills:** Before solving, ask "About how much should the answer be?" This builds number sense
- **Story Creation:** Have children create their own word problems using fractions from their daily experiences

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Identifying the operation needed (addition vs. subtraction)
**Try this:** Look for key words and phrases: "total," "altogether," "combined" suggest addition; "left," "remaining," "more needed" suggest subtraction.

**If students struggle with:** Subtracting from 1 whole
**Try this:** Always convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator first. Show that 1 = \(\tfrac{2}{2}\) = \(\tfrac{3}{3}\) = \(\tfrac{4}{4}\), etc.

**If students struggle with:** Understanding what the answer means
**Try this:** Always return to the original problem context. "We found \(\tfrac{3}{8}\) - what does this mean in terms of the water tank?" Connect the mathematical result back to the real-world situation.

**If students struggle with:** Multi-step problems
**Try this:** Break complex problems into smaller steps. Write each step clearly and check that the answer makes sense before moving to the next step.

**If students struggle with:** Choosing appropriate real-world examples
**Try this:** Start with familiar contexts like food, time, and money. These are the most intuitive places to apply fraction concepts in daily life.
