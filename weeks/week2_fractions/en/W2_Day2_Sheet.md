## üîç Worked Example

**Discovering Equivalent Fractions Using a Fraction Wall**

Your mission: Use a fraction wall to prove that \(\tfrac{2}{4}=\tfrac{1}{2}\) and understand why they're equivalent.

**Step 1:** Build your fraction wall understanding
- The fraction wall shows different ways to divide a whole into equal parts
- Each row represents the same whole length, just divided differently
- When segments from different rows align perfectly, the fractions are equivalent

**Step 2:** Compare \(\tfrac{2}{4}\) and \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) visually
- Look at the row divided into 4 equal parts (fourths)
- Take 2 of those parts: that's \(\tfrac{2}{4}\)
- Look at the row divided into 2 equal parts (halves)  
- Take 1 of those parts: that's \(\tfrac{1}{2}\)
- Notice: These segments cover exactly the same length!

**Step 3:** Understand the mathematical relationship
- \(\tfrac{2}{4}\) = \(\tfrac{2√∑2}{4√∑2}\) = \(\tfrac{1}{2}\)
- We can divide both numerator and denominator by the same number (2)
- This creates an equivalent fraction that represents the same amount

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Equivalent fractions show us that the same quantity can be expressed in multiple ways - this flexibility is powerful in mathematics.

## üìù Guided Practice

**1. Using the fraction wall:**
Find an equivalent fraction for \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) by looking at the sixths row. Answer: \(\tfrac{1}{3} = \tfrac{\_\_}{6}\)

**2. Simplifying fractions:**
Find an equivalent fraction for \(\tfrac{3}{6}\) by reducing to lowest terms. Answer: \(\tfrac{3}{6} = \tfrac{\_\_}{\_\_}\)

**3. Multiple equivalents:**
Which fraction is equal to \(\tfrac{2}{8}\)? Choose from: \(\tfrac{1}{4}\), \(\tfrac{1}{3}\), or \(\tfrac{3}{12}\). Explain your choice.

**4. Creative representations:**
Draw two different fractions that are equal to \(\tfrac{1}{2}\). Use different shapes or different denominators.

**5. Comparing equivalents:**
Using the fraction wall, which is larger: \(\tfrac{3}{4}\) or \(\tfrac{6}{8}\)? How can you tell?

## üöÄ Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Open `fraction_wall.ipynb` and color all the bars that are equivalent to \(\tfrac{1}{2}\). Discover how many different ways you can represent the same amount.

**Investigation questions:**
- How many different equivalent fractions can you find for \(\tfrac{1}{2}\)?
- What pattern do you notice in the numerators and denominators?
- Which equivalent fraction has the largest denominator in your wall?

**Paper Fallback:** Create a chart showing at least 4 equivalent fractions for \(\tfrac{1}{2}\). Draw visual models (circles, rectangles, or bars) to prove each equivalence. Include: \(\tfrac{1}{2}\), \(\tfrac{2}{4}\), \(\tfrac{3}{6}\), and \(\tfrac{4}{8}\).

**Real-world connection:** Think about cooking measurements. If a recipe calls for \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) cup of flour, could you use \(\tfrac{2}{4}\) cup instead? Why or why not?
