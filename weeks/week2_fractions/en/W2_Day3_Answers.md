# W2 Day 3: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Building fluency:**
\(\tfrac{1}{5}+\tfrac{1}{5}=\) ____

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{2}{5}\)

**Teaching Tip:** Have students draw a rectangle divided into 5 equal parts. Shade 1 part, then shade 1 more part. Count the total shaded: 2 out of 5. This visual reinforces that we're combining equal-sized pieces.

**2. More challenging:**
\(\tfrac{2}{6}+\tfrac{3}{6}=\) ____

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{5}{6}\) (can be simplified, but not required at this level)

**Teaching Tip:** Point out that \(\tfrac{5}{6}\) is close to 1 whole - only \(\tfrac{1}{6}\) is missing. This helps students develop number sense about fraction sizes.

**3. Practice with eighths:**
\(\tfrac{4}{8}+\tfrac{1}{8}=\) ____

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{5}{8}\)

**Teaching Tip:** Note that \(\tfrac{4}{8} = \tfrac{1}{2}\), so we're adding \(\tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{8}\). The remaining unshaded fraction is \(\tfrac{3}{8}\). Check: \(\tfrac{5}{8} + \tfrac{3}{8} = \tfrac{8}{8} = 1\).

**4. Using sevenths:**
\(\tfrac{3}{7}+\tfrac{2}{7}=\) ____

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{5}{7}\)

**Teaching Tip:** \(\tfrac{5}{7}\) is greater than \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) (since \(\tfrac{3.5}{7} = \tfrac{1}{2}\)) but less than 1. This comparison helps students develop intuition about fraction magnitude.

**5. Working with ninths:**
\(\tfrac{5}{9}+\tfrac{1}{9}=\) ____

**Answer:** \(\tfrac{6}{9}\) (which equals \(\tfrac{2}{3}\))

**Teaching Tip:** To make 1 whole, we would need to add \(\tfrac{3}{9}\) more. This gives practice with complementary fractions - pairs that add to 1.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Which fraction sum today felt easiest? Why? Also, explain in your own words why the denominator stays the same when adding fractions with like denominators.

**Sample Answers:**
- **Easiest:** "Adding \(\tfrac{1}{5}+\tfrac{1}{5}\) was easiest because both numerators were 1, so I just added 1+1=2"
- **Denominator explanation:** "The denominator stays the same because we're adding pieces of the same size. Like if you have 2 quarters and add 3 more quarters, you still have quarters - just more of them"
- **Alternative explanation:** "The bottom number tells us what size pieces we're working with. When we add pieces of the same size, the piece size doesn't change"

**Teaching Tip:** Look for understanding of the "same-sized pieces" concept. This is crucial for later work with unlike denominators.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Visual First:** Always start with drawings or manipulatives before moving to abstract addition
- **Real-World Connections:** Use pizza slices, pie pieces, or chocolate bar sections to make addition concrete
- **Pattern Recognition:** Help students see that only numerators change when denominators are the same
- **Simplification:** If students notice that \(\tfrac{6}{9} = \tfrac{2}{3}\), celebrate this insight but don't require it yet

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Adding the denominators instead of keeping them the same
**Try this:** Use the pizza analogy: "If you eat 2 slices of pizza and your friend eats 3 slices of the same pizza, you ate 5 slices total. The pizza was still cut into 8 slices (or whatever the denominator is)."

**If students struggle with:** Understanding why denominators stay the same
**Try this:** Use manipulatives like fraction bars or circles. Physically show that when you combine pieces of the same size, you get more pieces but the size doesn't change.

**If students struggle with:** Visualizing the problems
**Try this:** Provide pre-drawn fraction models for struggling students. Have them color in the appropriate sections rather than drawing from scratch.

**If students struggle with:** Knowing when they're close to 1 whole
**Try this:** Practice "fraction completion" - given \(\tfrac{5}{8}\), ask "What do you need to add to make 1?" This builds number sense about fraction relationships.
