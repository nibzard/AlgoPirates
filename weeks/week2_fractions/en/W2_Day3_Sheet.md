# W2 Day 3: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators

‚è± **Duration:** 30 minutes

## üîç Worked Example

**Adding Fractions with the Same Denominator**

Your mission: Add \(\tfrac{1}{4}+\tfrac{2}{4}\) and understand why this method works.

**Step 1:** Understand what we're adding
- \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) means "1 piece out of 4 equal pieces"
- \(\tfrac{2}{4}\) means "2 pieces out of 4 equal pieces"
- We want to know: "How many pieces total out of 4 equal pieces?"

**Step 2:** Visualize the addition
- Draw a rectangle divided into 4 equal parts
- Shade 1 part to show \(\tfrac{1}{4}\)
- Shade 2 more parts to show \(\tfrac{2}{4}\)
- Count the total shaded parts: 3 out of 4

**Step 3:** Apply the mathematical rule
- When denominators are the same, we add the numerators: 1 + 2 = 3
- The denominator stays the same: 4
- Result: \(\tfrac{1}{4}+\tfrac{2}{4}=\tfrac{3}{4}\)

**Step 4:** Verify with common sense
- We started with pieces of the same size (fourths)
- We combined them, so we still have pieces of the same size
- The denominator (4) tells us the size of each piece, which doesn't change

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** When we add fractions with like denominators, we're combining equal-sized parts - this is why only the numerators change.

## üìù Guided Practice

**1. Building fluency:**
\(\tfrac{1}{5}+\tfrac{1}{5}=\) ____
Draw a visual model to verify your answer.

**2. More challenging:**
\(\tfrac{2}{6}+\tfrac{3}{6}=\) ____
Can you simplify this answer? If so, what do you get?

**3. Practice with eighths:**
\(\tfrac{4}{8}+\tfrac{1}{8}=\) ____
What fraction of the whole is left unshaded?

**4. Using sevenths:**
\(\tfrac{3}{7}+\tfrac{2}{7}=\) ____
Is this result closer to \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) or to 1? How can you tell?

**5. Working with ninths:**
\(\tfrac{5}{9}+\tfrac{1}{9}=\) ____
What would you need to add to this result to make a whole?

## üöÄ Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Open `fraction_wall.ipynb` and use the visual fraction bars to model addition problems. Try to predict the sums before using the visualizations.

**Investigation activities:**
- Model \(\tfrac{1}{6}+\tfrac{2}{6}+\tfrac{1}{6}\) using the fraction wall
- Create your own three-addend fraction problem with eighths
- Find a combination of fourths that adds up to exactly 1 whole

**Paper Fallback:** Create your own fraction addition story problems. For example: "Maria ate \(\tfrac{2}{8}\) of a pizza and her brother ate \(\tfrac{3}{8}\) of the same pizza. How much pizza did they eat together?" Draw pictures to show your solutions.

**Real-world connection:** Think about measuring ingredients for cooking. If you add \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) cup of sugar and \(\tfrac{2}{4}\) cup of sugar, how much sugar do you have total? How does this connect to today's math?
