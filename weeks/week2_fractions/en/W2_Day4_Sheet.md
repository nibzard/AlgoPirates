## üîç Worked Example

**Comparing Fractions Using Multiple Strategies**

Your mission: Decide which is larger, \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) or \(\tfrac{1}{3}\), and learn different ways to compare fractions.

**Strategy 1: Visual comparison**
- Draw two identical rectangles
- Divide the first into 2 equal parts, shade 1 part (\(\tfrac{1}{2}\))
- Divide the second into 3 equal parts, shade 1 part (\(\tfrac{1}{3}\))
- Compare: The \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) piece is clearly larger

**Strategy 2: Number line reasoning**
- On a number line from 0 to 1, \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) is at the halfway point
- \(\tfrac{1}{3}\) is one-third of the way from 0 to 1
- Since \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) lies to the right of \(\tfrac{1}{3}\), it's greater

**Strategy 3: Common denominator method**
- Convert to equivalent fractions with the same denominator
- \(\tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{3}{6}\) and \(\tfrac{1}{3} = \tfrac{2}{6}\)
- Since 3 > 2, we know \(\tfrac{3}{6} > \tfrac{2}{6}\), so \(\tfrac{1}{2} > \tfrac{1}{3}\)

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Having multiple strategies for comparing fractions helps us choose the most efficient method for different problems.

## üìù Guided Practice

**1. Same denominator comparison:**
Which is greater: \(\tfrac{2}{5}\) or \(\tfrac{3}{5}\)? Explain your reasoning without drawing pictures.

**2. Different denominators (unit fractions):**
Order from least to greatest: \(\tfrac{1}{6}, \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}\)
Hint: Think about which "pieces" are bigger when the whole is divided into fewer parts.

**3. Same denominator, smaller values:**
Which is smaller: \(\tfrac{4}{8}\) or \(\tfrac{3}{8}\)? How do you know?

**4. Number line practice:**
Draw a number line from 0 to 1. Place and label these fractions: \(\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{3}{4}\)

**5. Proximity to 1:**
Which is closer to 1: \(\tfrac{5}{6}\) or \(\tfrac{4}{6}\)? How far is each fraction from 1?

## üöÄ Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Open `fraction_wall.ipynb` and investigate how the visual patterns in different rows help you compare fractions. Focus on finding relationships between different fraction families.

**Advanced investigations:**
- Compare \(\tfrac{2}{3}\), \(\tfrac{3}{4}\), and \(\tfrac{1}{2}\) using the fraction wall
- Find all fractions in the wall that are greater than \(\tfrac{1}{2}\)
- Discover which fractions are very close to 1 (like \(\tfrac{7}{8}\) or \(\tfrac{5}{6}\))

**Paper Fallback:** Create a "fraction detective" chart. Choose 6 different fractions and arrange them from smallest to largest. For each fraction, write whether it's less than \(\tfrac{1}{2}\), equal to \(\tfrac{1}{2}\), or greater than \(\tfrac{1}{2}\). Use drawings to justify your decisions.

**Real-world connection:** Compare these situations: "I ate \(\tfrac{3}{4}\) of my sandwich" vs "I ate \(\tfrac{2}{3}\) of my sandwich." Which person ate more? How might this type of comparison be useful in daily life?

## üéØ Exit Ticket

Write down a real-world situation where comparing fractions would be useful. Explain which fractions you might need to compare and why it matters to know which is larger.
