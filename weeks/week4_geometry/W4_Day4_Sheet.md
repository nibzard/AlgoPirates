# Week 4 Day 4 – Geometry

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Find the area of a right triangle with base 6 cm and height 4 cm.
Area = base × height ÷ 2 → 6 × 4 ÷ 2 = 12 cm².

## Guided Practice
1. Area of a right triangle base 5 cm, height 3 cm
2. Area of a triangle base 8 cm, height 2 cm
3. Sketch a right triangle and label its base and height
4. If a triangle has base 10 cm and height 6 cm, what is its area?
5. What happens to area if you double the height but keep the base?

## Challenge
6. Explain why dividing by 2 finds the area of a triangle.
7. Draw two different triangles with area 16 cm².
8. Name an everyday object that is shaped like a triangle.

## Stretch / Colab
In `pixel_flag.ipynb`, add a triangle to your flag.
Paper Fallback: On the back, create a triangle puzzle with three right triangles.

## Exit Ticket
Write one question you still have about triangles.
