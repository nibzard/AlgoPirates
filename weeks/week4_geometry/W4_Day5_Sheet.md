# Week 4 Day 5 – Geometry

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Calculate the area of a flag made of a 6 cm by 4 cm rectangle.
Area = 6 × 4 = 24 cm².

## Guided Practice
1. Draw a small flag 5 cm by 3 cm and find its area
2. Add a right triangle to one side with base 3 cm and height 3 cm. What is its area?
3. Find the total area of your flag now
4. What is the perimeter of the original rectangle?
5. Design a flag that has total area 30 cm²

## Challenge
6. Explain why both area and perimeter matter when sewing a flag
7. How could you divide a rectangle into two triangles of equal area?
8. Name a country with a triangle in its flag

## Stretch / Colab
Open `pixel_flag.ipynb` and recreate your design with code.
Paper Fallback: On the back, grid out your flag and write its dimensions.

## Exit Ticket
Write one question about using area in art or design.
