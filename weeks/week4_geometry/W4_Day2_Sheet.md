# Week 4 Day 2 â€“ Geometry

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Find the perimeter of a rectangle 3 cm by 5 cm.
Add all sides: 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 16 cm.

## Guided Practice
1. Perimeter of a 4 cm by 6 cm rectangle
2. Perimeter of a square with sides 7 cm
3. Perimeter of a triangle with sides 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm
4. Measure the perimeter of a book using centimeters
5. Draw a shape with a perimeter of 12 cm

## Challenge
6. A rectangle has a perimeter of 20 cm and one side is 4 cm. What is the other side?
7. Explain how perimeter helps when building a fence.
8. Name an object at home you could measure.

## Stretch / Colab
Use `pixel_flag.ipynb` to draw a rectangle and see its outline.
Paper Fallback: On the back, trace a real object and find its perimeter.

## Exit Ticket
Write one thing that uses perimeter in real life.
