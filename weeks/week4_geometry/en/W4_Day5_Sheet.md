# W4 Day 5: Geometry in Design (Flag Project)

⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Calculating Area for Design Projects**

**Question:** Calculate the total area needed for a flag made of a 6 cm by 4 cm rectangle.

**Step 1:** Identify the shape and measurements
- Shape: Rectangle
- Dimensions: 6 cm by 4 cm

**Step 2:** Apply the area formula
- Rectangle area = length × width
- Area = 6 × 4 = 24 cm²

**Step 3:** Consider the design context
- This tells us how much fabric we need
- For a real flag, we'd also need to consider seam allowances

**Answer:** 24 cm²

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Geometry helps us solve real-world design problems by calculating materials needed and space requirements.

## 📝 Guided Practice

**1. Basic flag design:** Draw a rectangular flag 5 cm by 3 cm and calculate its area.

**2. Adding elements:** Add a right triangle to one side of your rectangle. If the triangle has base 3 cm and height 3 cm, what is its area?

**3. Total area:** Find the total area of your flag design (rectangle + triangle).

**4. Perimeter check:** What is the perimeter of the original 5 cm by 3 cm rectangle?

**5. Design challenge:** Create a flag design that has a total area of exactly 30 cm². Use any combination of rectangles and triangles.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Become a flag designer! Research a real country's flag that contains geometric shapes. Calculate the approximate area of each shape if the flag were 20 cm by 12 cm. Present your findings with drawings and calculations.

**Real-world connection:** Designers, architects, and artists use geometry daily to plan projects, calculate materials, and create beautiful, functional designs!

**Colab Connection:** Open `pixel_flag.ipynb` and recreate your flag design using code. Experiment with different dimensions and colors.

**Paper Fallback:** Design your own country's flag using graph paper. Include at least one rectangle and one triangle. Label all dimensions and calculate the total area and perimeter.
