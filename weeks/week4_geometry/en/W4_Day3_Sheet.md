# W4 Day 3: Area - Measuring Inside Shapes

⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Finding the Area of a Rectangle**

**Question:** Find the area of a rectangle that is 4 cm by 8 cm.

**Step 1:** Understand what area means
- Area = the amount of space inside a shape
- We measure area in square units (like cm²)

**Step 2:** Visualize the rectangle
- Imagine filling the rectangle with 1 cm × 1 cm squares
- Length = 8 cm means 8 squares fit along the length
- Width = 4 cm means 4 squares fit along the width

**Step 3:** Calculate the total squares
- Total squares = 8 × 4 = 32 squares
- Area = 32 cm²

**Answer:** 32 cm²

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Area measures how much surface space a shape covers, always in square units.

## 📝 Guided Practice

**1. Square area:** Find the area of a square with sides 5 cm long.

**2. Rectangle area:** Find the area of a rectangle 7 cm by 2 cm.

**3. Real-world problem:** A sheet of paper is 8 cm by 11 cm. What is its area?

**4. Design challenge:** Draw a rectangle that has an area of exactly 20 cm².

**5. Reverse problem:** If a rectangle has area 24 cm² and one side is 4 cm, what is the other side?

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Become an area expert! Explain why we use square units (like cm²) for area instead of regular units (like cm). Draw a picture to help your explanation.

**Real-world connection:** Area helps us know how much paint to buy for a wall, how much carpet for a floor, or how much grass seed for a lawn!

**Colab Connection:** Use `pixel_flag.ipynb` to experiment with changing flag dimensions and observe how it affects the total area.

**Paper Fallback:** Use graph paper to color in a shape that has an area of exactly 30 square units. Try to make it an interesting shape, not just a rectangle!
