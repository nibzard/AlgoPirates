# W4 Day 1: Shape Names and Properties - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Answers

**1. Shape identification:** 
   Triangle symbols to circle: ‚ñ≥ and ‚ñ∑ 
   - Both ‚ñ≥ and ‚ñ∑ are triangles (3 sides, 3 angles)
   - ‚óã is a circle, ‚ñ° is a square, ‚óá is a diamond/rhombus

**2. Polygon naming:** **Quadrilateral**
   - Any four-sided polygon is called a quadrilateral
   - This includes squares, rectangles, rhombuses, trapezoids, and irregular four-sided shapes

**3. Counting sides:** A hexagon has **6 sides**
   - Remember: "hex" means six (like hexagonal nuts and bolts)

**4. Special properties:** A **circle** has no straight sides
   - Circles are made of one curved line with no corners or angles

**5. Shape relationships:** **Yes**, every square is also a rectangle
   - A rectangle has 4 sides and 4 right angles
   - A square has 4 equal sides and 4 right angles
   - Since squares meet all rectangle requirements, squares are special rectangles

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Shape hunt examples:**
- **Triangle:** roof peak, slice of pizza, yield sign
- **Square:** window panes, floor tiles, sticky notes  
- **Rectangle:** doors, books, phone screens
- **Circle:** plates, clocks, wheels
- **Hexagon:** honeycomb cells, hex nuts, some floor tiles

## üéØ Exit Ticket Sample Answers

- "I learned that squares are special rectangles - I thought they were completely different!"
- "I never noticed hexagons before, but now I see them in nuts and bolts"
- "Triangles can look very different but still be triangles as long as they have 3 sides"
- "Circles are the only common shape with no straight sides at all"

## üí° Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Shapes are classified by their properties (sides, angles) not appearance
- Shape families have relationships (squares are special rectangles)
- Geometric vocabulary builds spatial reasoning skills

**Shape property patterns:**
- **Triangle:** 3 sides, 3 angles
- **Quadrilateral:** 4 sides, 4 angles (includes squares, rectangles, etc.)
- **Pentagon:** 5 sides, 5 angles  
- **Hexagon:** 6 sides, 6 angles

**If your child struggles:**
- Use real objects to show shape examples
- Count sides and corners together with your finger
- Start with very different shapes before similar ones
- Draw shapes together and label their properties

**Real-world connections:**
- Architecture uses triangles for strength, rectangles for efficiency
- Nature often shows hexagons (honeycomb, snowflakes)
- Traffic signs use shapes to convey meaning (triangular yield, octagonal stop)

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child thinks squares aren't rectangles
  - **Help:** List rectangle properties, then check if squares have them all
- **Mistake:** Child counts same side twice on polygon
  - **Help:** Use different colored pencils for each side while counting
