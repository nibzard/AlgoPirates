## 🔍 Worked Example

**Finding the Area of a Triangle**

**Question:** Find the area of a right triangle with base 6 cm and height 4 cm.

**Step 1:** Understand the triangle area formula
- Triangle area = (base × height) ÷ 2
- We divide by 2 because a triangle is half of a rectangle

**Step 2:** Visualize why we divide by 2
- Imagine a rectangle with the same base and height: 6 cm × 4 cm = 24 cm²
- A triangle takes up exactly half that rectangle
- So triangle area = 24 ÷ 2 = 12 cm²

**Step 3:** Apply the formula directly
- Area = (base × height) ÷ 2
- Area = (6 × 4) ÷ 2 = 24 ÷ 2 = 12 cm²

**Answer:** 12 cm²

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Triangles are always exactly half the area of a rectangle with the same base and height.

## 📝 Guided Practice

**1. Basic triangle area:** Find the area of a right triangle with base 5 cm and height 3 cm.

**2. Another triangle:** Find the area of a triangle with base 8 cm and height 2 cm.

**3. Drawing practice:** Sketch a right triangle and clearly label its base and height.

**4. Larger triangle:** If a triangle has base 10 cm and height 6 cm, what is its area?

**5. Pattern investigation:** What happens to the area if you double the height but keep the base the same?

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Design a triangle puzzle! Draw two different triangles that both have an area of 16 cm². Show your calculations to prove they both have the same area.

**Real-world connection:** Triangular shapes are everywhere - from pizza slices to roof peaks to road signs. Triangle area helps architects design roofs and engineers build strong structures!

**Colab Connection:** In `pixel_flag.ipynb`, add a triangular design element to your flag and calculate its area.

**Paper Fallback:** Create a triangle art project! Draw and cut out several triangles, then arrange them to form a larger shape. Calculate the total area.
