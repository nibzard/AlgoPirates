# W4 Day 2: Perimeter - Measuring Around Shapes

⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Finding the Perimeter of a Rectangle**

**Question:** Find the perimeter of a rectangle that is 3 cm by 5 cm.

**Step 1:** Understand what perimeter means
- Perimeter = the distance around the outside of a shape
- We need to add up all the side lengths

**Step 2:** Identify all sides of the rectangle
- Length = 5 cm (appears twice - top and bottom)
- Width = 3 cm (appears twice - left and right sides)

**Step 3:** Add all sides together
- Perimeter = 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 16 cm
- Or use the shortcut: Perimeter = 2 × (length + width) = 2 × (5 + 3) = 16 cm

**Answer:** 16 cm

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Perimeter is always about the total distance around the outside edge of any shape.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Solve this perimeter puzzle! A rectangle has a perimeter of 20 cm and one side is 4 cm. What is the length of the other side? Show your thinking step by step.

**Real-world connection:** Perimeter helps us know how much fencing to buy for a yard, how much trim to put around a room, or how far it is to walk around a soccer field!

**Colab Connection:** Use `pixel_flag.ipynb` to create shapes and visualize their outlines.

**Paper Fallback:** Find a rectangular object at home (like a picture frame or tablet). Trace around it and measure its perimeter with a ruler.
