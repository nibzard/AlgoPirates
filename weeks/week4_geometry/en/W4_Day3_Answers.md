# W4 Day 3: Area - Measuring Inside Shapes - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Square area:** Square with 5 cm sides
   - Area = 5 × 5 = **25 cm²**
   - For squares: Area = side × side

**2. Rectangle area:** Rectangle 7 cm by 2 cm
   - Area = 7 × 2 = **14 cm²**
   - For rectangles: Area = length × width

**3. Real-world problem:** Paper 8 cm by 11 cm
   - Area = 8 × 11 = **88 cm²**
   - This is about the size of a standard letter paper

**4. Design challenge:** Rectangle with area 20 cm²
   - Sample answers: 4 cm × 5 cm, 2 cm × 10 cm, 1 cm × 20 cm
   - Any two numbers that multiply to 20 work

**5. Reverse problem:** Area 24 cm², one side 4 cm
   - 24 ÷ 4 = **6 cm**
   - Check: 4 × 6 = 24 cm² ✓

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Why square units for area:**
- Area measures surface coverage - how many square tiles fit inside
- We use square units because we're covering a 2D surface
- A 1 cm² square is our "measuring tile"
- Example: A 3×4 rectangle holds 12 one-unit squares, so area = 12 square units

**Visual explanation:**
```
□□□□  ← 4 squares across
□□□□  ← 3 rows of squares  
□□□□  
Total: 3 × 4 = 12 square units
```

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Sample Answers

**Methods for calculating area:**
- **Rectangle/Square:** "Multiply length times width"
- **Counting:** "Count the square units inside the shape"
- **Formula:** "Use Area = l × w for rectangles"

**Real-life examples:**
- "Buying carpet for my bedroom floor"
- "Figuring out how much paint for a wall"
- "Planning how many tiles for a bathroom"
- "Calculating grass seed needed for a lawn"

## 💡 Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Area measures the space inside a 2D shape
- Always expressed in square units (cm², m², etc.)
- For rectangles: Area = length × width
- For squares: Area = side × side

**Understanding square units:**
- Think of tiling a floor with square tiles
- Each tile represents one square unit
- Area = total number of tiles needed

**Common area formulas:**
- **Rectangle:** A = length × width
- **Square:** A = side²
- **Triangle:** A = (base × height) ÷ 2
- **Circle:** A = π × radius² (for later)

**If your child struggles:**
- Use graph paper to visualize area
- Start with counting squares before using formulas
- Make it concrete with real tiles or blocks
- Connect to familiar objects (floor tiles, pizza slices)

**Real-world connections:**
- Home improvement (paint, flooring, wallpaper)
- Gardening (seed coverage, fertilizer)
- Sports fields (grass maintenance)
- Art projects (paper needed, canvas size)

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child confuses area with perimeter
  - **Help:** "Area is inside space, perimeter is around the edge"
- **Mistake:** Child forgets square units
  - **Help:** Always ask "square what?" after getting the number
- **Mistake:** Child uses wrong formula
  - **Help:** Draw the shape and count squares to verify
