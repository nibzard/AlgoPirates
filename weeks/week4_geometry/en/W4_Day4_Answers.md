# W4 Day 4: Triangle Area - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Basic triangle area:** Base 5 cm, height 3 cm
   - Area = (5 × 3) ÷ 2 = 15 ÷ 2 = **7.5 cm²**

**Teaching Tip:** Show that triangles are exactly half of rectangles with the same base and height. Draw a 5×3 rectangle (area 15 cm²), then draw a diagonal to create two identical triangles. Each triangle has area 15÷2 = 7.5 cm².

**2. Another triangle:** Base 8 cm, height 2 cm
   - Area = (8 × 2) ÷ 2 = 16 ÷ 2 = **8 cm²**

**Teaching Tip:** Emphasize that base and height must be perpendicular (form a 90° angle). For this tall, narrow triangle, visualize folding a 8×2 rectangle in half along the diagonal - you get two triangles with area 8 cm² each.

**3. Drawing practice:** 
   - Student should draw a right triangle with a clear 90° angle
   - Base should be labeled along the bottom edge
   - Height should be labeled as the perpendicular line from base to opposite vertex

**Teaching Tip:** Right triangles are easiest for beginners because the base and height are clearly visible as the two perpendicular sides. Later, students will learn that any side can be the base, and height is always the perpendicular distance to the opposite vertex.

**4. Larger triangle:** Base 10 cm, height 6 cm
   - Area = (10 × 6) ÷ 2 = 60 ÷ 2 = **30 cm²**

**Teaching Tip:** Connect to the rectangle concept: a 10×6 rectangle has area 60 cm², so each triangular half has area 30 cm². This reinforces that triangle area is always half the corresponding rectangle area.

**5. Pattern investigation:** Doubling the height doubles the area
   - Original: Area = (base × height) ÷ 2
   - Double height: Area = (base × 2×height) ÷ 2 = 2 × (base × height) ÷ 2
   - The area doubles when height doubles

**Teaching Tip:** This pattern helps students understand proportional relationships. If height doubles, area doubles. If base doubles, area doubles. If both double, area becomes four times larger. This connects to algebra concepts they'll learn later.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Two triangles with area 16 cm²:**

**Triangle 1:** Base = 8 cm, Height = 4 cm
- Area = (8 × 4) ÷ 2 = 32 ÷ 2 = 16 cm²

**Triangle 2:** Base = 4 cm, Height = 8 cm
- Area = (4 × 8) ÷ 2 = 32 ÷ 2 = 16 cm²

**Other possibilities:**
- Base = 16 cm, Height = 2 cm → Area = (16 × 2) ÷ 2 = 16 cm²
- Base = 2 cm, Height = 16 cm → Area = (2 × 16) ÷ 2 = 16 cm²

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Solution

**Sample student response:**
"I discovered that triangles are exactly half of rectangles with the same base and height! That's why we divide by 2 in the area formula. The coolest part was learning that if you double the height, you double the area. I'm curious about how to find the height of triangles that aren't right triangles - I noticed in right triangles the height is easy to see, but what about other triangles? I also wonder why builders use so many triangles in roof construction."

**Key insights students should demonstrate:**
- Understanding the "half of rectangle" concept
- Recognition that base and height must be perpendicular
- Curiosity about triangles beyond right triangles
- Connection to proportional relationships (doubling height doubles area)
- Real-world applications and questions

## 🏠 Teaching Tips for Parents

• **Common mistakes to watch for:** Students often forget to divide by 2, use sides that aren't perpendicular for base and height, or struggle with decimal answers like 7.5 cm². They might also think the formula only works for right triangles. Emphasize that ALL triangles use the same formula and are half of their corresponding rectangle.

• **Visual support strategies:** Cut paper rectangles diagonally to create triangle pairs. Use origami or paper folding to show how triangles fold into rectangles. Draw rectangles on graph paper, then shade triangular halves to make the relationship concrete. Use pizza slices to discuss triangular area in real life.

• **Real-world connections:** Point out triangular architecture (roof peaks, bridges, towers) and explain how triangles provide structural strength. Discuss triangular sails on boats, triangular flags, and triangular musical instruments. Connect to art and design where triangles create dynamic, stable compositions.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

• **If students struggle with identifying perpendicular base and height:** Use the "carpenter's square" approach - show that base and height must form a perfect corner (90° angle). Have them use the corner of a piece of paper to check if lines are perpendicular. Practice drawing heights from different bases to show the concept.

• **If students forget to divide by 2:** Create the memory phrase "triangles are half" and practice saying "base times height divided by 2" as one unit. Show the rectangle-triangle connection visually every time until it becomes automatic. Ask "What's half of [base × height]?" rather than giving the full formula.

• **If students get confused by decimal area answers:** Explain that 7.5 cm² means "7 whole unit squares plus half of another unit square." Draw this on graph paper so they can see the partial square. Connect to money (7.5 dollars = 7 dollars and 50 cents) or time (7.5 hours = 7 hours and 30 minutes).
