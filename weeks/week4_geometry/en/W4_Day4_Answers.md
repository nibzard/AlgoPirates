# W4 Day 4: Triangle Area - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Basic triangle area:** Base 5 cm, height 3 cm
   - Area = (5 × 3) ÷ 2 = 15 ÷ 2 = **7.5 cm²**

**2. Another triangle:** Base 8 cm, height 2 cm
   - Area = (8 × 2) ÷ 2 = 16 ÷ 2 = **8 cm²**

**3. Drawing practice:** 
   - Student should draw a right triangle with a clear 90° angle
   - Base should be labeled along the bottom edge
   - Height should be labeled as the perpendicular line from base to opposite vertex

**4. Larger triangle:** Base 10 cm, height 6 cm
   - Area = (10 × 6) ÷ 2 = 60 ÷ 2 = **30 cm²**

**5. Pattern investigation:** Doubling the height doubles the area
   - Original: Area = (base × height) ÷ 2
   - Double height: Area = (base × 2×height) ÷ 2 = 2 × (base × height) ÷ 2
   - The area doubles when height doubles

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Two triangles with area 16 cm²:**

**Triangle 1:** Base = 8 cm, Height = 4 cm
- Area = (8 × 4) ÷ 2 = 32 ÷ 2 = 16 cm²

**Triangle 2:** Base = 4 cm, Height = 8 cm
- Area = (4 × 8) ÷ 2 = 32 ÷ 2 = 16 cm²

**Other possibilities:**
- Base = 16 cm, Height = 2 cm → Area = (16 × 2) ÷ 2 = 16 cm²
- Base = 2 cm, Height = 16 cm → Area = (2 × 16) ÷ 2 = 16 cm²

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Sample Answers

**Questions students might have:**
- "How do you find the height of a triangle that's not a right triangle?"
- "Can you find the area of any triangle, not just right triangles?"
- "Why are triangles used so much in buildings?"

**Explanations of dividing by 2:**
- "A triangle is exactly half of a rectangle with the same base and height"
- "If you put two identical triangles together, they make a rectangle"
- "Triangles take up half the space of a rectangle"

## 💡 Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Triangle area = (base × height) ÷ 2
- Any side can be the base; height is always perpendicular to the base
- Triangle area is always half the area of a rectangle with same base and height

**Understanding the formula:**
- Visualize: Two identical triangles make a rectangle
- The ÷2 accounts for the triangle being half a rectangle
- Base and height must be perpendicular (form a 90° angle)

**Identifying base and height:**
- **Base:** Any side of the triangle (often the bottom)
- **Height:** Perpendicular distance from base to opposite vertex
- Height may be inside or outside the triangle

**If your child struggles:**
- Use paper triangles and rectangles to show the relationship
- Draw the rectangle first, then cut it diagonally
- Use graph paper to count squares and verify the formula
- Start with right triangles where base and height are obvious

**Real-world connections:**
- Architecture: Roof triangles, truss supports
- Food: Pizza slices, sandwich halves
- Sports: Pennant flags, sailboat sails
- Art: Geometric designs, quilt patterns

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child uses wrong measurements for base/height
  - **Help:** Emphasize they must be perpendicular
- **Mistake:** Child forgets to divide by 2
  - **Help:** Always ask "Is this half of a rectangle?"
- **Mistake:** Child gets confused with decimal answers
  - **Help:** Show that 7.5 cm² means 7 whole squares plus half a square
