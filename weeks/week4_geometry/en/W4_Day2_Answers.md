# W4 Day 2: Perimeter - Measuring Around Shapes - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Rectangle perimeter:** 4 cm by 6 cm rectangle
   - Perimeter = 4 + 6 + 4 + 6 = **20 cm**
   - Or: Perimeter = 2 × (4 + 6) = 2 × 10 = **20 cm**

**2. Square perimeter:** Square with 7 cm sides
   - Perimeter = 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = **28 cm**
   - Or: Perimeter = 4 × 7 = **28 cm**

**3. Triangle perimeter:** Triangle with sides 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm
   - Perimeter = 3 + 4 + 5 = **12 cm**
   - Note: This is a right triangle (3² + 4² = 5²)

**4. Real measurement:** Answers will vary based on book size
   - Typical textbook might be approximately 25 cm × 20 cm
   - Perimeter would be about 2 × (25 + 20) = 90 cm

**5. Design challenge:** Sample answer - a 3 cm × 3 cm square
   - Perimeter = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 cm
   - Other possibilities: 4 cm × 2 cm rectangle, 5 cm × 1 cm rectangle

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Perimeter puzzle:** Rectangle with perimeter 20 cm, one side is 4 cm

**Step-by-step solution:**
1. **Set up:** Perimeter = 20 cm, one side = 4 cm
2. **Rectangle fact:** Opposite sides are equal, so we have two sides of 4 cm
3. **Calculate:** 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 cm remaining for the other two sides
4. **Find other side:** 12 ÷ 2 = 6 cm
5. **Check:** 4 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 20 cm ✓

**Answer:** The other side is **6 cm**

## 💡 Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Perimeter is the distance around the outside of any shape
- Add all side lengths together to find perimeter
- For rectangles: P = 2 × (length + width)
- For squares: P = 4 × side length

**Common perimeter formulas:**
- **Any shape:** Add all sides
- **Rectangle:** P = 2l + 2w or P = 2(l + w)
- **Square:** P = 4s
- **Regular polygon:** P = number of sides × side length

**If your child struggles:**
- Use string or yarn to "walk around" the shape's edge
- Count sides carefully - don't miss any or count twice
- Draw and label each side before adding
- Use real objects to make it concrete

**Real-world practice activities:**
- Measure rooms for baseboards or trim
- Calculate fencing needed for gardens
- Find perimeter of sports fields or courts
- Measure picture frames or mirrors

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child forgets to include all sides
  - **Help:** Point to each side while counting, use different colors
- **Mistake:** Child confuses perimeter with area
  - **Help:** "Perimeter is around the edge, like walking around the outside"
- **Mistake:** Child makes arithmetic errors
  - **Help:** Double-check addition, use calculator if needed for verification
