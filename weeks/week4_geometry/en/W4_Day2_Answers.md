# W4 Day 2: Perimeter - Measuring Around Shapes - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Rectangle perimeter:** 4 cm by 6 cm rectangle
   - Perimeter = 4 + 6 + 4 + 6 = **20 cm**
   - Or: Perimeter = 2 √ó (4 + 6) = 2 √ó 10 = **20 cm**

**Teaching Tip:** Show both methods - adding all sides and using the formula. Emphasize that rectangles have opposite sides equal, so we add each measurement twice. The formula P = 2(l + w) is a shortcut for P = l + w + l + w.

**2. Square perimeter:** Square with 7 cm sides
   - Perimeter = 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = **28 cm**
   - Or: Perimeter = 4 √ó 7 = **28 cm**

**Teaching Tip:** For squares, emphasize that all four sides are equal, making multiplication the most efficient method. Connect to real-world examples like fence posts - if you need posts every 7 cm around a square garden, you'd need 4 √ó 7 = 28 cm of spacing.

**3. Triangle perimeter:** Triangle with sides 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm
   - Perimeter = 3 + 4 + 5 = **12 cm**
   - Note: This is a right triangle (3¬≤ + 4¬≤ = 5¬≤)

**Teaching Tip:** For triangles, there's no shortcut formula - you must add all three sides. This is a famous "3-4-5" right triangle. Point out that perimeter is always the same regardless of shape - just add all the sides around the outside edge.

**4. Real measurement:** Answers will vary based on book size
   - Typical textbook might be approximately 25 cm √ó 20 cm
   - Perimeter would be about 2 √ó (25 + 20) = 90 cm

**Teaching Tip:** Real measurements make math meaningful. Encourage students to estimate first, then measure to check their estimation skills. Discuss why textbooks are rectangular (efficient paper use, easy stacking, comfortable to hold).

**5. Design challenge:** Sample answer - a 3 cm √ó 3 cm square
   - Perimeter = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 cm
   - Other possibilities: 4 cm √ó 2 cm rectangle, 5 cm √ó 1 cm rectangle

**Teaching Tip:** This problem shows that many different rectangles can have the same perimeter. Help students discover the pattern: as rectangles get longer and skinnier, the perimeter stays the same but the area changes. This connects to optimization problems in real life.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Perimeter puzzle:** Rectangle with perimeter 20 cm, one side is 4 cm

**Step-by-step solution:**
1. **Set up:** Perimeter = 20 cm, one side = 4 cm
2. **Rectangle fact:** Opposite sides are equal, so we have two sides of 4 cm
3. **Calculate:** 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 cm remaining for the other two sides
4. **Find other side:** 12 √∑ 2 = 6 cm
5. **Check:** 4 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 20 cm ‚úì

**Answer:** The other side is **6 cm**

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Sample student response:**
"Perimeter is used everywhere in real life! When my dad built a fence around our backyard, he had to measure the perimeter to know how much fencing to buy. Picture frames need the exact perimeter measurement so they fit perfectly. Even when I run around the soccer field, I'm running the perimeter. I learned that different rectangles can have the same perimeter, like a 3√ó3 square and a 4√ó2 rectangle both have perimeter 12 cm."

**Key applications students should mention:**
- Home improvement projects (fencing, trim, borders)
- Sports and recreation (track running, field boundaries)
- Crafts and art (framing, edging)
- Problem-solving (finding shapes with specific perimeters)

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

‚Ä¢ **Common mistakes to watch for:** Students often confuse perimeter with area, or forget to include all sides when calculating. They might also struggle with the concept that different rectangles can have the same perimeter. Emphasize that perimeter is "walking around the outside edge" of a shape.

‚Ä¢ **Visual support strategies:** Use string, yarn, or tape to physically outline shapes and measure their perimeter. Walk around objects like tables or rooms while counting steps. Create a "perimeter hunt" where students find objects and measure their borders with measuring tape.

‚Ä¢ **Real-world connections:** Involve students in home projects like measuring for picture frames, calculating fencing for gardens, or determining how much trim is needed for a room. Discuss how runners measure track distances, how builders calculate material needs, and how landscapers plan garden borders.

## üîß Troubleshooting

‚Ä¢ **If students struggle with forgetting to include all sides:** Try the "finger walk" method - use your finger to trace completely around the shape while saying each measurement aloud. Use different colored pencils to mark each side as you add it to prevent double-counting or missing sides.

‚Ä¢ **If students confuse perimeter with area:** Use concrete analogies: "Perimeter is like walking around the outside of a park, area is like the grass inside the park." Have them physically walk around rectangular objects while measuring perimeter, then discuss what's "inside" versus "around the edge."

‚Ä¢ **If students make arithmetic errors in addition:** Encourage them to double-check by adding in a different order, or use a calculator to verify their hand calculations. For rectangles, show them both methods (adding all sides vs. using the formula) and check that they get the same answer.
