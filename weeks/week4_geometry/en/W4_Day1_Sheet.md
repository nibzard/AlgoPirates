⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Identifying Shapes by Their Properties**

**Question:** Name a shape with three sides and three angles.

**Step 1:** Think about what we know
- The shape has 3 sides
- The shape has 3 angles (corners)

**Step 2:** Identify the shape
- A shape with exactly 3 sides and 3 angles is called a **triangle**
- All triangles have 3 sides and 3 angles, no matter their size

**Answer:** Triangle

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Shapes are defined by their properties (number of sides, angles, etc.), not just how they look.

## 📝 Guided Practice

**1. Shape identification:** Circle all the triangles in this group: △ ○ □ ▷ ◇

**2. Polygon naming:** What is the name for any four-sided polygon?

**3. Counting sides:** How many sides does a hexagon have?

**4. Special properties:** Which common shape has no straight sides at all?

**5. Shape relationships:** Is every square also a rectangle? Explain your thinking.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Become a shape detective! Walk around your home and find at least one example of each shape: triangle, square, rectangle, circle, and hexagon. Draw or describe what you found.

**Real-world connection:** Shapes are everywhere in architecture, art, nature, and design. Architects use different shapes for both beauty and strength!

**Colab Connection:** Open `pixel_flag.ipynb` and experiment with changing the colors of the geometric shapes.

**Paper Fallback:** Design your own flag using at least 4 different shapes. Label each shape and color it in.
