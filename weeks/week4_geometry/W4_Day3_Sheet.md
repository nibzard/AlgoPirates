# Week 4 Day 3 – Geometry

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Find the area of a rectangle 4 cm by 8 cm.
Multiply sides: 4 × 8 = 32 cm².

## Guided Practice
1. Area of a square with side 5 cm
2. Area of a rectangle 7 cm by 2 cm
3. A sheet of paper is 8 cm by 11 cm. What is its area?
4. Draw a rectangle with area 20 cm²
5. If a rectangle has area 24 cm² and one side is 4 cm, what is the other side?

## Challenge
6. Explain why area uses square units.
7. Sketch a rectangle with area 36 cm² but not a square.
8. Describe how you might cover a floor with tiles using area.
