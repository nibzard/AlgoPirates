# Week 5 Day 4 – Data & Chance

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: What is the chance of flipping heads on one coin toss?

There are two equally likely results: heads or tails. So the chance of heads is 1 out of 2, or 1/2.

## Guided Practice
1. Chance of rolling a 3 on a standard die
2. Chance of drawing a heart from a deck of cards
3. Chance of picking a red marble from a bag with 2 red and 3 blue marbles
4. Chance of rolling a number greater than 4 on a die
5. Chance of getting tails on a coin

## Challenge
6. Explain why probability always lies between 0 and 1.
7. If you flip two coins, how many outcomes are possible?
8. Describe an event that is impossible and one that is certain.

## Stretch / Colab
Open `coin_flips.ipynb` and complete lines 8–17 to run 100 flips and plot the bar graph. **Paper fallback:** on the back, predict how many heads you might get out of 20 tosses.

## Exit Ticket
Write one new word you learned about probability.
