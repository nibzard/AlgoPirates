## üìù Guided Practice Answers

**1. Missing data problem:** Birds votes with total = 20
   - Known votes: 7 + 8 = 15
   - Missing: 20 - 15 = **5**

**2. Extend the table:** Sample completed table:

| Animal | Votes |

| Cats | 7 |
| Dogs | 8 |
| Birds | 5 |
| Fish | 3 |

(Students can choose any animal and reasonable vote count)

**3. Data analysis:** Two important things data tables show:
   - **Comparison:** Which option is most/least popular
   - **Organization:** Keep information neat and easy to read
   - **Patterns:** See trends and relationships in the data
   - **Totals:** Calculate sums and missing values

**4. Create your own:** Sample snacks table:

| Snack | Votes |

| Chips | 8 |
| Fruit | 6 |
| Cookies | 4 |

## üí° Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Data tables organize information in rows and columns
- Tables make it easy to compare values and find patterns
- Missing values can be calculated using known information
- Tables are the foundation for graphs and charts

**Parts of a data table:**
- **Headers:** Labels that describe what each column contains
- **Rows:** Individual data entries or categories
- **Columns:** Different types of information (like name and value)
- **Data:** The actual numbers or information in each cell

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simple 2-column tables (item and count)
- Use familiar topics (family members' ages, favorite foods)
- Practice reading tables before creating them
- Use physical objects to represent data before writing numbers

**Real-world connections:**
- **Sports:** Team standings, player statistics
- **School:** Grade reports, attendance records  
- **Weather:** Temperature readings, rainfall amounts
- **Shopping:** Price comparisons, product ratings

**Creating effective tables:**
- Choose clear, descriptive headers
- Keep categories simple and distinct
- Use realistic numbers that make sense
- Check that totals add up correctly

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child confuses rows and columns
  - **Help:** "Rows go across (like reading), columns go down (like falling)"
- **Mistake:** Child can't find missing values
  - **Help:** "Add up what you know, then subtract from the total"
- **Mistake:** Child makes tables that are hard to read
  - **Help:** Use grid paper and write neatly, one item per cell
