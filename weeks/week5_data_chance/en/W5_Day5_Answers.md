# W5 Day 5: Designing and Conducting Surveys - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Food survey:** Sample question:
   "What is your favorite type of snack?"
   - Alternative: "Which meal do you enjoy most?"
   - Alternative: "What vegetable do you like best?"

**Teaching Tip:** Good survey questions are clear, unbiased, and focused on one topic. Help students avoid leading questions ("Don't you think pizza is the best food?") and compound questions ("What's your favorite food and color?"). Simple, direct questions yield better data.

**2. Multiple choice:** Three good answer choices for snack question:
   - Fruit (like apples, oranges)
   - Chips/crackers
   - Cookies/sweets
   - Include "Other" option for responses not listed

**Teaching Tip:** Multiple choice options should be mutually exclusive (no overlap) and collectively exhaustive (cover most possibilities). The "Other" option catches responses that don't fit the main categories and prevents forced choices.

**3. Data collection:** Efficient ways to collect from 10 classmates:
   - Create a simple form and pass it around
   - Ask each person individually and record in a tally chart
   - Use an online form if technology is available
   - Stand in one spot and have classmates come to you

**Teaching Tip:** Different collection methods work better in different situations. For small groups, personal interviews give rich data. For larger groups, forms are more efficient. Teach students to match their method to their situation and resources.

**4. Visualization planning:** Best graph types:
   - **Bar graph:** Shows exact numbers clearly
   - **Pictograph:** Fun and easy to understand
   - **Pie chart:** Shows proportions of the whole (advanced)

**Teaching Tip:** Help students choose graph types based on their data and audience. Bar graphs work well for comparing categories. Pictographs engage younger audiences. Pie charts show parts of a whole but are more complex to create and interpret.

**5. Question design:** Keep questions short and clear because:
   - People understand them better
   - Less chance of confusion
   - Faster to answer
   - More people willing to participate

**Teaching Tip:** Good question design is crucial for valid data collection. Long, complex questions lead to misunderstandings and inconsistent responses. Teach students to test their questions on a few people before conducting the full survey.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Sample mini-survey design:**

**Question 1:** "What is your favorite school subject?"
- Math, Science, English, Art, Other

**Question 2:** "How do you get to school?"
- Walk, Car, Bus, Bike, Other

**Data collection plan:**
1. Print survey forms
2. Ask during lunch or break time
3. Use tally charts for quick counting
4. Create bar graphs for results

**Presentation ideas:**
- Poster with graphs and key findings
- Short presentation to class
- Newsletter for parents

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Sample student response:** "I would like to conduct a survey about favorite school subjects because I'm curious whether more students prefer math or reading. I would ask 'What is your favorite school subject?' with choices like Math, Reading, Science, Art, and Other. I would collect data by asking classmates during lunch and recording their answers on a tally sheet. Then I would create a bar graph to show the results and present my findings to the class."

**Additional acceptable responses:**
- "Pet ownership in our class - I want to know how many classmates have pets"
- "Video game preferences - I'm curious what games my friends like"
- "Favorite seasons - I wonder if more people like summer or winter"
- "Music preferences - I want to see what music styles are popular"
- "Weekend activities - I'm interested in what my classmates do for fun"

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Surveys gather information from groups of people
- Good questions are clear, short, and unbiased
- Data must be organized to find patterns
- Results can be shared through graphs and presentations

**Elements of good surveys:**
- **Clear purpose:** Know what you want to learn
- **Simple questions:** Easy to understand and answer
- **Appropriate choices:** Cover most expected answers
- **Organization:** Plan how to collect and record data

**Survey design principles:**
- Ask one thing at a time
- Avoid leading questions ("Don't you think...?")
- Provide "Other" option for unexpected answers
- Keep it short to maintain interest

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with familiar topics (family, friends, interests)
- Use yes/no questions before multiple choice
- Practice with small groups (family members)
- Help them organize data in simple tables

**Data collection tips:**
- Use tally marks for easy counting
- Have a backup plan if some people don't respond
- Encourage honest answers, not "right" answers
- Be respectful of people who don't want to participate

**Real-world connections:**
- **School:** Student council elections, cafeteria menu planning
- **Business:** Customer satisfaction, product development
- **Government:** Census data, public opinion polls
- **Entertainment:** TV ratings, movie preferences

**Sharing results:**
- Create colorful graphs and charts
- Write 2-3 key findings
- Discuss surprises in the data
- Think about what the results mean

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with designing clear survey questions, try this:** Use the "5W" approach - Who, What, When, Where, Why. Help them focus on one clear question at a time. Practice by having them ask family members simple preference questions and refine based on responses.

**If students struggle with organizing collected data, try this:** Start with simple tally sheets with pre-drawn categories. Show them how to make one mark for each response, then count the marks. Use colored pencils to make different categories visually distinct.

**If students struggle with interpreting their survey results, try this:** Ask guiding questions: "What do you notice?" "Which category got the most responses?" "Does anything surprise you?" Help them distinguish between what the data shows and what they think it might mean.
