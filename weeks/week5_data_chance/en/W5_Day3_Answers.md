# W5 Day 3: Finding Averages (Mean) - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Basic mean:** 4, 6, and 10
   - (4 + 6 + 10) ÷ 3 = 20 ÷ 3 = **6.67** (or about 6.7)

**Teaching Tip:** When introducing mean calculation, emphasize the two-step process: first add all values, then divide by the count. Help students understand that the mean represents the "fair share" if all values were distributed equally among the data points.

**2. Equal values:** 3, 9, and 9
   - (3 + 9 + 9) ÷ 3 = 21 ÷ 3 = **7**

**Teaching Tip:** This problem shows how repeated values affect the mean. The two 9s "pull" the average higher than the middle value. This helps students understand that the mean considers all values, not just unique ones.

**3. Four numbers:** 1, 2, 3, and 4
   - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) ÷ 4 = 10 ÷ 4 = **2.5**

**Teaching Tip:** This example produces a mean that's not one of the original numbers, which can surprise students. Explain that the mean doesn't have to match any of the actual data points - it represents the balance point of all the data.

**4. Two numbers:** 12 and 18
   - (12 + 18) ÷ 2 = 30 ÷ 2 = **15**

**Teaching Tip:** With just two numbers, the mean is exactly halfway between them. This connects to students' understanding of finding the midpoint and helps them visualize the mean as a balance point on a number line.

**5. All the same:** 5, 5, and 5
   - (5 + 5 + 5) ÷ 3 = 15 ÷ 3 = **5**
   - Note: When all numbers are the same, the mean equals that number

**Teaching Tip:** This special case helps students understand that when there's no variation in data, the mean is simply that constant value. This reinforces the concept of mean as the "typical" value in a dataset.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Investigation: Adding data to change the mean**

**Original set:** 2, 5, 7
- Original mean = (2 + 5 + 7) ÷ 3 = 14 ÷ 3 = 4.67

**After adding 7:** 2, 5, 7, 7
- New mean = (2 + 5 + 7 + 7) ÷ 4 = 21 ÷ 4 = **5.25**
- The mean increased because we added a number (7) that was above the original mean

**Creating a set with mean 6:**
Sample answer: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Check: (3 + 6 + 7 + 8) ÷ 4 = 24 ÷ 4 = 6 ✓
- Other possibilities: 4, 5, 6, 9 or 2, 6, 6, 10, etc.

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Solution

**Sample student response:** "The mean (average) is useful in many real-life situations. In school, teachers use average grades to see how students are doing overall. Sports teams use batting averages to compare players. Weather forecasters use average temperatures to help us know what to expect. At home, parents might look at average chore completion to decide on allowances. The mean helps us understand typical values when we have lots of different numbers."

**Additional acceptable responses:**
- **School grades:** "Report cards show average grades to see overall performance"
- **Weather:** "Average temperature helps predict what to wear"
- **Sports:** "Batting averages show how good a baseball player is"
- **Money:** "Average allowance helps parents decide what's fair"
- **Time:** "Average travel time helps plan when to leave for school"

## 🏠 Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Mean = sum of all values ÷ number of values
- The mean represents the "typical" or "center" value
- Adding values above the mean increases it; below the mean decreases it
- All values must be included in the calculation

**Understanding the mean:**
- Think of it as "sharing equally" - if all values were the same, what would they be?
- The mean balances high and low values
- It's one way to describe the center of a data set

**Common situations for means:**
- **Academic:** Test scores, grade point averages
- **Sports:** Points per game, batting averages
- **Daily life:** Average expenses, time taken, temperatures
- **Business:** Sales figures, customer ratings

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with small, simple numbers
- Use concrete examples (sharing candies equally)
- Practice the two-step process: add first, then divide
- Check answers by seeing if they seem reasonable

**Working with decimals:**
- Round to one decimal place for simplicity
- Explain that 6.67 is "between 6 and 7, closer to 7"
- Use context to decide if rounding makes sense

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with the two-step mean calculation, try this:** Break it into separate, clear steps. First, have them add all numbers and write down the sum. Then, count how many numbers they added and write that down. Finally, divide the sum by the count. Keep these steps visible until the process becomes automatic.

**If students struggle with understanding what the mean represents, try this:** Use concrete examples like sharing candy equally among friends. If you have 3, 7, and 8 pieces of candy to share among 3 people, how many would each person get? This physical redistribution helps them grasp the "fair share" concept.

**If students struggle with decimal answers, try this:** Start with data sets that produce whole number means, then gradually introduce examples with decimal results. Explain that 6.5 means "halfway between 6 and 7" and relate it to familiar concepts like time (6:30 is halfway between 6:00 and 7:00).
