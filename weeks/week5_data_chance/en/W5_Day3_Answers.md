# W5 Day 3: Finding Averages (Mean) - Answer Key

## ๐ Guided Practice Answers

**1. Basic mean:** 4, 6, and 10
   - (4 + 6 + 10) รท 3 = 20 รท 3 = **6.67** (or about 6.7)

**2. Equal values:** 3, 9, and 9
   - (3 + 9 + 9) รท 3 = 21 รท 3 = **7**

**3. Four numbers:** 1, 2, 3, and 4
   - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) รท 4 = 10 รท 4 = **2.5**

**4. Two numbers:** 12 and 18
   - (12 + 18) รท 2 = 30 รท 2 = **15**

**5. All the same:** 5, 5, and 5
   - (5 + 5 + 5) รท 3 = 15 รท 3 = **5**
   - Note: When all numbers are the same, the mean equals that number

## ๐ Stretch Activity Solution

**Investigation: Adding data to change the mean**

**Original set:** 2, 5, 7
- Original mean = (2 + 5 + 7) รท 3 = 14 รท 3 = 4.67

**After adding 7:** 2, 5, 7, 7
- New mean = (2 + 5 + 7 + 7) รท 4 = 21 รท 4 = **5.25**
- The mean increased because we added a number (7) that was above the original mean

**Creating a set with mean 6:**
Sample answer: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Check: (3 + 6 + 7 + 8) รท 4 = 24 รท 4 = 6 โ
- Other possibilities: 4, 5, 6, 9 or 2, 6, 6, 10, etc.

- The mean represents the "typical" or "center" value
- Adding values above the mean increases it; below the mean decreases it
- All values must be included in the calculation

**Understanding the mean:**

- **Business:** Sales figures, customer ratings

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with small, simple numbers
- Use concrete examples (sharing candies equally)
- Practice the two-step process: add first, then divide
- Check answers by seeing if they seem reasonable

**Working with decimals:**
- Round to one decimal place for simplicity
- Explain that 6.67 is "between 6 and 7, closer to 7"
- Use context to decide if rounding makes sense

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child forgets to count all values
  - **Help:** List each number and count them clearly
- **Mistake:** Child adds incorrectly
  - **Help:** Double-check addition before dividing
- **Mistake:** Child doesn't understand when to use mean
