## üîç Worked Example

**Understanding Basic Probability**

**Question:** What is the chance of flipping heads on one coin toss?

**Step 1:** Identify all possible outcomes
- A coin can land in two ways: heads or tails
- Both outcomes are equally likely

**Step 2:** Count favorable outcomes
- We want heads: there is 1 way to get heads
- Total possible outcomes: 2

**Step 3:** Calculate probability
- Probability = favorable outcomes √∑ total outcomes
- Probability of heads = 1 √∑ 2 = 1/2

**Step 4:** Interpret the result
- 1/2 means heads happens in about half of all flips
- This equals 0.5 or 50%

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Probability helps us predict how often something will happen when we repeat an experiment many times.

## üìù Guided Practice

**1. Die probability:** What's the chance of rolling a 3 on a standard 6-sided die?

**2. Card probability:** What's the chance of drawing a heart from a standard deck of cards? (Hint: 13 hearts out of 52 cards)

**3. Marble probability:** What's the chance of picking a red marble from a bag with 2 red and 3 blue marbles?

**4. Multiple outcomes:** What's the chance of rolling a number greater than 4 on a die?

**5. Coin again:** What's the chance of getting tails on a coin flip?

## üöÄ Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Explore the amazing world of two-coin flips! If you flip two coins at the same time, how many different outcomes are possible? List them all (like HH, HT, etc.) and calculate the probability of getting exactly one head.

**Real-world connection:** Probability helps predict weather, plan medical treatments, design games, and even decide which movies to recommend on streaming services!

**Colab Connection:** Open `coin_flips.ipynb` and complete the code to simulate 100 coin flips and see how close you get to the expected 50/50 split.

**Paper Fallback:** Predict how many heads you might get if you flipped a coin 20 times. Then explain your reasoning.
