⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Creating a Bar Graph from Data**

**Problem:** Draw a simple bar graph from this favorite color data.

| Color | Votes |
|-------|-------|
| Red   | 3     |
| Blue  | 5     |
| Green | 2     |

**Step 1:** Set up the graph
- Draw a horizontal line (x-axis) for colors
- Draw a vertical line (y-axis) for vote counts
- Label both axes clearly

**Step 2:** Create the bars
- Red bar goes up to 3
- Blue bar goes up to 5 (tallest)
- Green bar goes up to 2 (shortest)

**Step 3:** Add title and labels
- Title: "Favorite Colors Survey"
- Make sure each bar is labeled

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Graphs turn numbers into pictures, making it easy to see patterns and compare data at a glance.

## 📝 Guided Practice

**1. Reading the graph:** Which color had the most votes in the worked example?

**2. Extending data:** Add a bar for "Yellow" with 4 votes to your graph.

**3. Calculating totals:** How many total votes are there after adding Yellow?

**4. Understanding graphs:** What does each bar on a bar graph represent?

**5. Alternative visualization:** Sketch a pictograph using smiley faces (😊) for the same color data. Let each face = 1 vote.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Compare graph types! Create both a bar graph AND a pictograph for the same data set. Then write 2-3 sentences explaining when you might prefer one type over the other.

**Real-world connection:** Graphs help us understand everything from election results to sports scores to weather patterns. News websites use graphs to make complicated information easy to understand!

**Paper Fallback:** Design your own survey about favorite school subjects. Create both a data table and a bar graph for your imaginary results.
