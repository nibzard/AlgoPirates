## üîç Worked Example

**Using Data Tables to Organize Information**

**Problem:** Fill in the missing value in this table of favorite fruits from a class survey.

| Fruit | Votes |
|-------|-------|
| Apple | 6 |
| Banana | 4 |
| Orange | ? |

**Total votes: 15**

**Step 1:** Understand what we know
- Apple received 6 votes
- Banana received 4 votes  
- Total votes were 15
- We need to find Orange's votes

**Step 2:** Calculate the missing value
- Known votes: 6 + 4 = 10
- Missing votes: 15 - 10 = 5
- Orange received 5 votes

**Step 3:** Complete the table

| Fruit | Votes |
|-------|-------|
| Apple | 6 |
| Banana | 4 |
| Orange | 5 |

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** Data tables help us organize information clearly and spot patterns or missing information.
