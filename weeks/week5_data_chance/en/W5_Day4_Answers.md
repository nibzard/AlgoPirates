# W5 Day 4: Introduction to Probability - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Answers

**1. Die probability:** Rolling a 3 on a 6-sided die
   - Favorable outcomes: 1 (only one way to roll 3)
   - Total outcomes: 6 (faces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
   - Probability = **1/6**

**2. Card probability:** Drawing a heart from a deck
   - Favorable outcomes: 13 (13 hearts in the deck)
   - Total outcomes: 52 (total cards)
   - Probability = 13/52 = **1/4**

**3. Marble probability:** Red marble from 2 red, 3 blue
   - Favorable outcomes: 2 (2 red marbles)
   - Total outcomes: 5 (2 + 3 = 5 total marbles)
   - Probability = **2/5**

**4. Multiple outcomes:** Rolling greater than 4 on a die
   - Favorable outcomes: 2 (rolling 5 or 6)
   - Total outcomes: 6
   - Probability = 2/6 = **1/3**

**5. Coin again:** Getting tails
   - Favorable outcomes: 1 (one way to get tails)
   - Total outcomes: 2
   - Probability = **1/2** (same as heads)

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Two-coin flip analysis:**

**All possible outcomes:** HH, HT, TH, TT
- Total outcomes: **4**

**Probability of exactly one head:**
- Favorable outcomes: HT, TH (2 ways)
- Probability = 2/4 = **1/2**

**Paper fallback prediction:** In 20 coin flips, expect about 10 heads
- Reasoning: Since probability is 1/2, we expect heads about half the time
- 20 √ó 1/2 = 10 heads (though actual results may vary)

## üéØ Exit Ticket Sample Answers

**New probability words:**
- **Outcome:** "An outcome is one possible result, like rolling a 4"
- **Favorable:** "Favorable means the outcomes we want to happen"
- **Equally likely:** "Each result has the same chance of happening"

**Real-life examples:**
- **Weather:** "Will it rain tomorrow? Weather apps use probability"
- **Games:** "What are my chances of winning this board game?"
- **Sports:** "What's the probability my team wins the championship?"
- **Daily life:** "What's the chance the bus is late?"

## üí° Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Probability = favorable outcomes √∑ total outcomes
- Probability is always between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain)
- Equal outcomes have equal probability
- Probability predicts long-term patterns, not individual results

**Probability vocabulary:**
- **Outcome:** A possible result of an experiment
- **Event:** A collection of outcomes we're interested in
- **Favorable outcomes:** The outcomes that match what we want
- **Equally likely:** All outcomes have the same chance

**Understanding fractions vs. percentages:**
- 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%
- 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%
- 1/6 ‚âà 0.167 ‚âà 16.7%

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simple, concrete examples (coin, die)
- Use physical objects they can touch and count
- Focus on listing all outcomes before calculating
- Connect to familiar games and activities

**Common misconceptions:**
- "If I flip 3 heads, the next flip is more likely to be tails" (not true)
- "Probability tells us exactly what will happen" (it shows long-term patterns)
- "Rare events never happen" (they're just less likely)

**Real-world connections:**
- **Games:** Board games, card games, sports outcomes
- **Medicine:** Treatment success rates, diagnostic accuracy
- **Business:** Market predictions, quality control
- **Science:** Experimental results, genetic inheritance

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Mistake:** Child confuses favorable with total outcomes
  - **Help:** Always ask "How many ways can this happen?" vs. "How many total possibilities?"
- **Mistake:** Child thinks probability guarantees results
  - **Help:** Explain it's about what happens "in the long run" with many trials
- **Mistake:** Child has trouble listing all outcomes
  - **Help:** Use systematic approaches like tree diagrams or organized lists
