# W5 Day 4: Introduction to Probability - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Die probability:** Rolling a 3 on a 6-sided die
   - Favorable outcomes: 1 (only one way to roll 3)
   - Total outcomes: 6 (faces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
   - Probability = **1/6**

**Teaching Tip:** Start probability instruction with concrete, countable outcomes like dice and coins. Help students systematically list all possible outcomes before identifying favorable ones. This builds the foundation for more complex probability concepts.

**2. Card probability:** Drawing a heart from a deck
   - Favorable outcomes: 13 (13 hearts in the deck)
   - Total outcomes: 52 (total cards)
   - Probability = 13/52 = **1/4**

**Teaching Tip:** Card problems introduce students to situations where favorable outcomes are numerous. Help them understand that there are multiple ways to achieve the desired result (any heart), but we still count total possibilities systematically.

**3. Marble probability:** Red marble from 2 red, 3 blue
   - Favorable outcomes: 2 (2 red marbles)
   - Total outcomes: 5 (2 + 3 = 5 total marbles)
   - Probability = **2/5**

**Teaching Tip:** Marble problems help students understand that probability depends on the composition of the group. More red marbles means higher probability of drawing red. Connect this to everyday situations like choosing from a mixed group.

**4. Multiple outcomes:** Rolling greater than 4 on a die
   - Favorable outcomes: 2 (rolling 5 or 6)
   - Total outcomes: 6
   - Probability = 2/6 = **1/3**

**Teaching Tip:** This problem shows how to handle events with multiple favorable outcomes. Emphasize careful counting: "greater than 4" means 5 OR 6, so we count both. This builds logical thinking about compound events.

**5. Coin again:** Getting tails
   - Favorable outcomes: 1 (one way to get tails)
   - Total outcomes: 2
   - Probability = **1/2** (same as heads)

**Teaching Tip:** Use coin flips to reinforce that equally likely outcomes have equal probabilities. This simple example helps students understand fairness and balance in probability situations.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Two-coin flip analysis:**

**All possible outcomes:** HH, HT, TH, TT
- Total outcomes: **4**

**Probability of exactly one head:**
- Favorable outcomes: HT, TH (2 ways)
- Probability = 2/4 = **1/2**

**Paper fallback prediction:** In 20 coin flips, expect about 10 heads
- Reasoning: Since probability is 1/2, we expect heads about half the time
- 20 √ó 1/2 = 10 heads (though actual results may vary)

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Sample student response:** "Today I learned important probability vocabulary. An outcome is any possible result, like rolling a 4 on a die. Favorable outcomes are the ones we want to happen - if I want to roll an even number, then 2, 4, and 6 are favorable. Equally likely means all outcomes have the same chance, like heads and tails on a coin flip. Probability helps us understand uncertainty in daily life, like predicting weather or sports results."

**Additional acceptable responses:**
**New probability words:**
- **Outcome:** "An outcome is one possible result, like rolling a 4"
- **Favorable:** "Favorable means the outcomes we want to happen"
- **Equally likely:** "Each result has the same chance of happening"

**Real-life examples:**
- **Weather:** "Will it rain tomorrow? Weather apps use probability"
- **Games:** "What are my chances of winning this board game?"
- **Sports:** "What's the probability my team wins the championship?"
- **Daily life:** "What's the chance the bus is late?"

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

**Key Concepts:**
- Probability = favorable outcomes √∑ total outcomes
- Probability is always between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain)
- Equal outcomes have equal probability
- Probability predicts long-term patterns, not individual results

**Probability vocabulary:**
- **Outcome:** A possible result of an experiment
- **Event:** A collection of outcomes we're interested in
- **Favorable outcomes:** The outcomes that match what we want
- **Equally likely:** All outcomes have the same chance

**Understanding fractions vs. percentages:**
- 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%
- 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%
- 1/6 ‚âà 0.167 ‚âà 16.7%

**If your child struggles:**
- Start with simple, concrete examples (coin, die)
- Use physical objects they can touch and count
- Focus on listing all outcomes before calculating
- Connect to familiar games and activities

**Common misconceptions:**
- "If I flip 3 heads, the next flip is more likely to be tails" (not true)
- "Probability tells us exactly what will happen" (it shows long-term patterns)
- "Rare events never happen" (they're just less likely)

**Real-world connections:**
- **Games:** Board games, card games, sports outcomes
- **Medicine:** Treatment success rates, diagnostic accuracy
- **Business:** Market predictions, quality control
- **Science:** Experimental results, genetic inheritance

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with distinguishing favorable from total outcomes, try this:** Use different colored objects (red and blue marbles) to make the distinction visual. Have them physically separate the "winning" outcomes from all possible outcomes. This concrete approach clarifies the fraction concept.

**If students struggle with the concept that probability doesn't guarantee results, try this:** Explain probability as "what we expect over many tries, not what definitely happens next time." Use the analogy of flipping a coin 100 times - we expect about 50 heads, but might get 48 or 53.

**If students struggle with systematic counting of outcomes, try this:** Introduce organized lists or simple tree diagrams. For two-coin flips, show them how to list: First coin H/Second coin H, First coin H/Second coin T, etc. This prevents missed or double-counted outcomes.
