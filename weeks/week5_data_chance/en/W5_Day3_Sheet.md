# W5 Day 3: Finding Averages (Mean)

⏱ **Duration:** 15 minutes

---

## 🔍 Worked Example

**Calculating the Mean (Average)**

**Problem:** Find the mean of these test scores: 2, 5, and 7.

**Step 1:** Add all the numbers together
- 2 + 5 + 7 = 14

**Step 2:** Count how many numbers we have
- We have 3 numbers total

**Step 3:** Divide the total by the count
- 14 ÷ 3 = 4.67 (or about 4.7)

**Step 4:** Interpret the result
- The average test score is about 4.7
- This represents the "typical" score in the group

**Mathematical Habit of Mind:** The mean gives us a single number that represents the center of a group of numbers, helping us understand the data as a whole.

## 📝 Guided Practice

**1. Basic mean:** Find the mean of 4, 6, and 10.

**2. Equal values:** Find the mean of 3, 9, and 9.

**3. Four numbers:** Find the mean of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**4. Two numbers:** Find the mean of 12 and 18.

**5. All the same:** Find the mean of 5, 5, and 5.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity / Colab Connection

**Your mission:** Investigate how adding data changes the mean! Start with the worked example (2, 5, 7). What happens to the mean if you add another 7 to the set? Then create your own set of four numbers that has a mean of exactly 6.

**Real-world connection:** Averages are everywhere! Grade point averages, batting averages in baseball, average temperature, average test scores - they help us summarize and compare groups of numbers.

**Paper Fallback:** Choose one of your practice problems and create a simple bar graph showing the individual numbers and mark where the mean falls.
