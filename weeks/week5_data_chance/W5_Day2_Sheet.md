# Week 5 Day 2 â€“ Data & Chance

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Draw a simple bar graph from this data.

| Colour | Votes |
|-------|------|
| Red   | 3    |
| Blue  | 5    |
| Green | 2    |

## Guided Practice
1. Which colour had the most votes?
2. Add a bar for "Yellow" with 4 votes.
3. How many votes in total after adding Yellow?
4. What does each bar on a graph represent?
5. Sketch a pictograph using smiley faces for the same data.

## Challenge
6. Explain one advantage of a bar graph over a pictograph.
7. Name a situation where a pictograph is more fun to read.
8. Describe how you could use colours wisely when printing in black and white.

## Stretch / Colab
No notebook today. **Paper fallback:** use the back to draw your own bar graph.

## Exit Ticket
Write one thing you found easy about graphs.
