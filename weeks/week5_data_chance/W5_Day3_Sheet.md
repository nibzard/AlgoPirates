# Week 5 Day 3 – Data & Chance

**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Find the mean of 2, 5, and 7.

Add the numbers: 2 + 5 + 7 = 14.
Divide by how many numbers: 14 ÷ 3 = 4.67 (about 5).

## Guided Practice
1. Mean of 4, 6, 10
2. Mean of 3, 9, 9
3. Mean of 1, 2, 3, 4
4. Mean of 12 and 18
5. Mean of 5, 5, 5

## Challenge
6. How does the mean change if you add another 7 to the worked example?
7. When might the mean not be the best measure?
8. Create your own set of four numbers with a mean of 6.

## Stretch / Colab
No notebook today. **Paper fallback:** on the back, sketch a quick bar graph of one set above.

## Exit Ticket
Write one place where you use averages in real life.
