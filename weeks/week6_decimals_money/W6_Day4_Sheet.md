**Duration:** 15 min

## Worked Example
Your mission: Make change for $1.00 after buying an item costing $0.63.

2. Change from $2.00 after spending $1.47
3. Change from $5.00 after spending $2.85
4. Change from $10.00 after spending $6.55
5. Change from $0.50 after spending $0.19

## Challenge
6. What combination of coins makes $0.37?
7. Explain why greedy change works with US coins.
8. Find change for $2.43 from $5.00.

## Stretch / Colab
Run `make_change.py` to automate your change calculations.
