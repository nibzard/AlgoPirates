## 🔍 Worked Example

**The "Count Up" Method for Making Change**

Customer buys item for $7.35, pays with $10.00

**Step 1:** Start with the cost: $7.35
**Step 2:** Count up to the next dollar using coins:
- Add 1 nickel: $7.35 → $7.40
- Add 1 dime: $7.40 → $7.50  
- Add 2 quarters: $7.50 → $8.00

**Step 3:** Count up to payment amount using bills:
- Add $2.00: $8.00 → $10.00

**Total change:** 1 nickel + 1 dime + 2 quarters + 2 ones = **$2.65**
