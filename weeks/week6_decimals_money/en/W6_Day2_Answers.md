# W6 Day 2: Converting Fractions to Decimals - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Convert to decimals:**
   - 4/10 = **0.4**
   - 25/100 = **0.25**

**2. Convert these mixed numbers:**
   - 1 and 6/10 = **1.6**
   - 3 and 45/100 = **3.45**

**3. Which is larger:** 0.8 or 0.80? **They are equal.** Adding zeros after the last digit doesn't change the value (0.8 = 0.80 = 8/10 = 80/100).

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solutions

Students should create visual representations showing:
- 1/10 = 0.1, 2/10 = 0.2, 5/10 = 0.5, etc.
- 25/100 = 0.25, 50/100 = 0.50, 75/100 = 0.75, etc.

## 💡 Teaching Tips

- Emphasize that /10 fractions become tenths, /100 fractions become hundredths
- Use money analogies: 25/100 dollars = $0.25 (25 cents)
- Reinforce that 0.8 and 0.80 represent the same amount
