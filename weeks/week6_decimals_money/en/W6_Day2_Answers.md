# W6 Day 2: Converting Fractions to Decimals - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Convert to decimals:**
   - 4/10 = **0.4**
   - 25/100 = **0.25**

**Teaching Tip:** Guide students to see the pattern: the denominator tells you the decimal place. When you have /10, the decimal goes to the tenths place. When you have /100, it goes to the hundredths place. Use money: 25/100 of a dollar is exactly 25 cents or $0.25.

**2. Convert these mixed numbers:**
   - 1 and 6/10 = **1.6**
   - 3 and 45/100 = **3.45**

**Teaching Tip:** Show students to keep the whole number part the same and convert only the fraction. Build it step by step: 1 and 6/10 = 1 + 0.6 = 1.6. Connect to real life: "1 and 6/10 pizzas eaten means you ate 1.6 pizzas total."

**3. Which is larger:** 0.8 or 0.80? **They are equal.** Adding zeros after the last digit doesn't change the value (0.8 = 0.80 = 8/10 = 80/100).

**Teaching Tip:** This is a crucial concept students often misunderstand. Use money: 80 cents = $0.80 = $0.8 (though we don't usually write it this way). Both represent the same amount. Use measuring cups: 0.8 liters = 0.80 liters.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

Students should create visual representations showing:
- 1/10 = 0.1, 2/10 = 0.2, 5/10 = 0.5, etc.
- 25/100 = 0.25, 50/100 = 0.50, 75/100 = 0.75, etc.

**Teaching Tip:** Encourage students to shade grids or draw pie charts. If they don't have grid paper, have them fold paper into 10 or 100 equal parts and shade the appropriate sections.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Convert 7/10 to a decimal and explain your thinking.

**Sample Answer:** 7/10 = 0.7 because when the denominator is 10, I put the numerator (7) in the tenths place. I can check this by thinking about money: 7/10 of a dollar is 70 cents, which is $0.70 or $0.7.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Common Mistake:** Students may write 4/10 as 0.04 instead of 0.4. Remind them that /10 fractions go in the tenths place (first place after decimal), not hundredths.
- **Visual Support:** Use a pizza or pie cut into 10 equal pieces. If 4 pieces are eaten, that's 4/10 or 0.4 of the pizza.
- **Real-World Connections:** Practice with sports statistics (batting averages), recipe measurements, or school grades (7/10 correct = 0.7 or 70%).

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Placing the decimal point correctly
**Try this:** Use a place value chart. Have them put the whole number in the ones place, then place the fraction part according to its denominator (10ths or 100ths).

**If students struggle with:** Understanding that 0.5 = 0.50
**Try this:** Use money models. Show that 5 dimes = 50 pennies = same amount. Draw it: 5 out of 10 boxes shaded = 50 out of 100 tiny boxes shaded.

**If students struggle with:** Mixed number conversions
**Try this:** Break it into two steps: "Keep the whole number the same, then convert just the fraction part." Practice with concrete examples: 2 and 3/10 cookies = 2.3 cookies total.
