Challenge: Plan a party with a $25 budget

**Step 1:** List what you need and research prices:
- Decorations: $8.50
- Snacks: $12.75
- Drinks: $6.25

**Step 2:** Calculate total cost:
$8.50 + $12.75 + $6.25 = $27.50

**Step 3:** Problem! $27.50 > $25.00 (over budget by $2.50)

**Step 4:** Adjust - find cheaper drinks for $3.75
New total: $8.50 + $12.75 + $3.75 = $25.00 ✓
