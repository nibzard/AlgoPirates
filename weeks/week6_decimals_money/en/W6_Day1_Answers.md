# W6 Day 1: Decimal Place Value - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Fill in the blanks:** The number 35.94 has **3** in the tens place, **9** in the tenths place, and **4** in the hundredths place.

**Teaching Tip:** Have students point to each digit while naming its place value. Use a place value chart to reinforce that position determines value. Practice with money: "35.94 means 35 dollars and 94 cents."

**2. Write in expanded form:** 18.52 = **10** + **8** + **0.5** + **0.02**
   (Alternative: 18.52 = 10 + 8 + 5/10 + 2/100)

**Teaching Tip:** Show both decimal and fraction forms to strengthen understanding. Connect to money: 18.52 = $18 + 50¬¢ + 2¬¢. Students often confuse 0.5 with 5, so emphasize "five-tenths" not "five."

**3. Create the decimal:** 7 ones + 3 tenths + 8 hundredths = **7.38**

**Teaching Tip:** Build the number step by step: start with 7, add 0.3 to get 7.3, then add 0.08 to get 7.38. Use base-10 blocks or decimal squares for visual learners.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

Students should draw or visualize:
- 1.35: 1 whole square + 35 small squares out of 100
- 0.78: 78 small squares out of 100 
- 2.06: 2 whole squares + 6 small squares out of 100

**Teaching Tip:** If students don't have grid paper, they can use money representations: 1.35 = 1 dollar + 3 dimes + 5 pennies.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** Why is the 4 in 35.94 worth less than the 4 in 35.49?

**Sample Answer:** In 35.94, the 4 is in the hundredths place, so it represents 4/100 or 0.04. In 35.49, the 4 is in the tenths place, so it represents 4/10 or 0.4. Since 0.4 is greater than 0.04, the position makes the digit worth more or less.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Common Mistake:** Students may think 0.5 is bigger than 0.50 because "50 is bigger than 5." Explain that these are equivalent using money: 50 cents = 5 dimes.
- **Visual Support:** Use a hundreds grid or base-10 blocks. Color in squares to show decimal values - this makes abstract concepts concrete.
- **Real-World Connections:** Practice with receipts from shopping - point out prices like $12.67 and break down the place values.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Decimal place value names (tenths, hundredths)
**Try this:** Connect to fractions first - 0.3 means "3 out of 10 parts" or 3/10. Use pie charts divided into 10 and 100 pieces.

**If students struggle with:** Comparing decimal values
**Try this:** Line up decimal points vertically and compare column by column, starting from the left. Use money examples: $2.30 vs $2.03.

**If students struggle with:** Understanding why 0.5 = 0.50
**Try this:** Use measuring cups - half a cup is the same whether you call it 5/10 or 50/100. Show with physical models that adding zeros after the decimal doesn't change the value.
