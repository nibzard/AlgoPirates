# W6 Day 5: Shopping Budget Challenge - Answer Key

## üìù Guided Practice Solutions

**1. School supplies budget:** You have $30. Calculate if you can afford:
   - Backpack: $18.75
   - Notebooks: $6.50
   - Pencils: $4.25
   - **Total: $29.50 Can you afford it? Yes** (with $0.50 left over)

**Teaching Tip:** Show students to add as they shop to track spending. Model: "Backpack $18.75 + notebooks $6.50 = $25.25. I have $4.75 left. Can I afford $4.25 pencils? Yes! Final total: $29.50, leaving $0.50 change." Emphasize staying under budget.

**2. Find the best deal:** Which pizza gives more value?
   - Small pizza: 8 slices for $12.00 = **$1.50** per slice
   - Large pizza: 12 slices for $16.50 = **$1.375** per slice
   - **Large pizza is the better deal**

**Teaching Tip:** Teach unit price calculation: "Divide total cost by number of slices." $12.00 √∑ 8 = $1.50 per slice. $16.50 √∑ 12 = $1.375 (about $1.38) per slice. Lower cost per unit = better deal. This skill applies to all comparison shopping.

**3. Budget adjustment:** Your grocery list costs $43.85 but you only have $40. 
   Possible solutions: Remove items worth $3.85+, substitute cheaper alternatives, use coupons, or add more money to budget.

**Teaching Tip:** This teaches real-world problem-solving. Discuss priorities: "What do you need vs. want? Could you buy a smaller size? Shop somewhere else? Wait for a sale?" Help students think critically about spending decisions.

## üöÄ Stretch Activity Solution

**Weekly lunch menu ($35 budget):**
- Monday: Sandwich + juice = $6.50
- Tuesday: Salad + water = $7.25  
- Wednesday: Pasta + milk = $6.75
- Thursday: Wrap + fruit = $7.00
- Friday: Pizza slice + soda = $7.25
- **Total: $34.75** (under budget by $0.25)

**Teaching Tip:** Praise staying under budget! Model checking: "Let me add: $6.50 + $7.25 = $13.75 for two days. Add $6.75 = $20.50 for three days." Continue building the total. Discuss how small amounts can add up quickly.

## üéØ Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** You want to buy 3 books. Book A costs $8.95, Book B costs $12.50, and Book C costs $7.25. Your budget is $25. Can you afford all three books?

**Sample Answer:** Total cost = $8.95 + $12.50 + $7.25 = $28.70. My budget is $25.00. Since $28.70 > $25.00, I cannot afford all three books. I need $3.70 more, or I could remove one book.

## üè† Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Common Mistake:** Children may not consider tax in their budget calculations. Practice adding 6-10% tax to purchases for realistic planning.
- **Visual Support:** Use grocery store flyers to practice comparison shopping. Circle the best deals together and explain your reasoning.
- **Real-World Connections:** Give children a small budget for a specific purchase (school supplies, gifts). Let them research and plan their spending.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Unit price calculations
**Try this:** Start with simple examples: "3 apples for $1.50. How much per apple? $1.50 √∑ 3 = $0.50 each." Use manipulatives to show division.

**If students struggle with:** Staying within budget
**Try this:** Role-play shopping with play money. Give them a fixed amount and have them "purchase" items, checking their total frequently.

**If students struggle with:** Making budget adjustments
**Try this:** Present scenarios: "You're $5 over budget. What are your options?" Brainstorm together: remove items, find substitutes, earn more money, etc.
