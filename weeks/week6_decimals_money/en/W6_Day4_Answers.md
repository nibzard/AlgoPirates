# W6 Day 4: Making Change Efficiently - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Answers

**1. Make change for:** Item costs $4.15, customer pays $5.00
   Change needed: **$0.85**
   Coins/bills to give: **3 quarters + 1 dime** (or equivalent combinations)

**2. Count up method:** Item costs $12.75, customer pays $20.00
   Count from $12.75 to $20.00: **$12.75 → $13.00 (quarter) → $20.00 ($7) = $7.25 total**

**3. Efficient change:** What's the fewest coins/bills for $3.40 in change?
   **1 five-dollar bill + 1 penny + 1 nickel + 1 dime + 1 quarter** (if giving from $5)
   Or: **3 ones + 1 quarter + 1 dime + 1 nickel**

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Notes

Students will practice the greedy algorithm (always use the largest denomination possible) in the Colab notebook to minimize the number of coins/bills needed.

## 💡 Teaching Tips
