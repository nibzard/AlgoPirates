# W6 Day 3: Adding and Subtracting Money - Answer Key

## 📝 Guided Practice Solutions

**1. Calculate the total cost:**
   - Sandwich: $4.25 + Drink: $1.75 = **$6.00**

**Teaching Tip:** Show students to line up decimal points vertically. Model the thinking: "$4.25 plus $1.75. I can add the cents first: 25¢ + 75¢ = 100¢ = $1.00. Then add the dollars: $4 + $1 + $1 = $6.00." Emphasize checking with estimation: "About $4 + $2 = $6, so $6.00 makes sense."

**2. Find the change:**
   - Item costs $6.30, you pay with $10.00 = **$3.70**

**Teaching Tip:** Teach the "count up" method to avoid subtraction errors. Count from $6.30 to $10.00: "$6.30 to $7.00 is 70¢, $7.00 to $10.00 is $3.00, so total change is $3.70." This mirrors how cashiers actually make change.

**3. Shopping list total:**
   - Apples: $2.85
   - Bread: $3.50  
   - Milk: $4.25
   - **Total = $10.60**

**Teaching Tip:** Have students estimate first: "About $3 + $4 + $4 = $11." Show step-by-step addition: $2.85 + $3.50 = $6.35, then $6.35 + $4.25 = $10.60. The estimate confirms our answer is reasonable.

## 🚀 Stretch Activity Solution

**Example $20 budget:**
- Pencils: $3.50
- Notebook: $4.25
- Ruler: $2.75
- Eraser: $1.50
- Markers: $6.75
- Total: $18.75, Change: $1.25

**Teaching Tip:** Encourage students to add as they go and check if they're staying within budget. Model the thinking: "So far I've spent $7.75 on pencils and notebook. I have $12.25 left. Can I afford the $2.75 ruler? Yes, because $7.75 + $2.75 = $10.50."

## 🎯 Exit Ticket Solution

**Question:** You buy a book for $8.95 and pay with a $10 bill. How much change should you receive?

**Sample Answer:** Change = $10.00 - $8.95 = $1.05. I can check this by counting up: $8.95 to $9.00 is 5¢, $9.00 to $10.00 is $1.00, so 5¢ + $1.00 = $1.05.

## 🏠 Teaching Tips for Parents

- **Common Mistake:** Students may forget to line up decimal points, getting wrong answers like $4.25 + $1.75 = $5.90. Always show them to stack numbers with decimals aligned.
- **Visual Support:** Use real money or play money to act out problems. Let children be the "cashier" and practice making change.
- **Real-World Connections:** Practice at the store by estimating totals before checkout and calculating exact change needed.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If students struggle with:** Decimal addition and subtraction
**Try this:** Use money manipulatives. Have them physically count out bills and coins, then combine them. This makes the abstract concrete.

**If students struggle with:** Making change
**Try this:** Teach the "count up" method instead of subtraction. Start with the cost and count up to the amount paid, just like real cashiers do.

**If students struggle with:** Remembering to line up decimal points
**Try this:** Use graph paper or have them draw vertical lines to keep decimals aligned. Practice writing money amounts in columns first.
