# Week 6 â€“ Decimals & Money

This week introduces decimal place value and practical money skills. Students learn to read, write, and compute with decimals while solving real-world problems involving money. The optional Python script `make_change.py` demonstrates a greedy algorithm for making change efficiently. Each day has a printable worksheet (`Sheet.md`) and answer key (`Answers.md`).
